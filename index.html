O'Donohue's instinctive awareness of the contrasts of his land -- its places of light and darkness, its movements and its stillness -- is magically brought to life in his richly lyrical yet deceptively transparent language.</p><p>Translating the beauty and splendor of Conamara into a language exquisitely attuned to the wonder of the everyday, O'Donohue takes us on a moving journey through real and imagined worlds. Divided into three parts -- Approachings, Encounters, and Distances -- <em>Conamara Blues</em> at once reawakens a sense of intimacy with the natural world and a feeling of wonder at the mystery of our relationship to this world. Whether exploring the silent, eternal memory of Conamara or focusing on the power of language and the vagaries of human need and passion, O'Donohue tenderly reveals the fragile vulnerability of love andfriendship. The result is a musical, transcendent, and deeply moving series of poems that exemplifies O'Donohue at his finest.</p><p>Written with penetrating insight and distilled transparence, <em>Conamara Blues</em> offers a singular and lasting imaginative vision of a landscape of hope and possibility -- powerfully exhibiting the mastery of a poet at the height of his lyric powers.</p></p><p><p>John O'Donohue was awarded a Ph.D. in philosophical theology from the University of T�bingen in 1990. He is the author of several works, including a book on the philosophy of Hegel, <em>Person als Vermittlung</em>; two collections of poetry, <em>Echoes of Memory</em> and <em>Conamara Blues</em>; and two international bestsellers, <em>Anam Cara</em> and <em>Eternal Echoes</em>. He lectures and holds workshops in Europe and America, and is currently researching a book on the philosophical mysticism of Meister Eckhart.

He is well known for his eight-year run as writer of the DC Comics' title <i>The Flash</i>, as well as his scripting of the limited series <i>Kingdom Come</i> and <i>Superman: Birthright</i>, and his work on Marvel Comics' <i>Captain America</i>. From August 2007 to December 2010, Waid served as Editor-in-Chief, and later, Chief Creative Officer of BOOM! Studios, where he wrote titles such as <i>Irredeemable</i>, <i>Incorruptible</i> and <i>The Traveler</i>.*Starred Review* Waid&#x2019;s relaunched Daredevil won the 2012 Eisner Awards for best continuing series and best writer, and the second collected volume provides solid evidence for the kudos. The writing is as strong as ever, capturing nuances of the hero&#x2019;s intelligence, humor, and despair even as it&#x2019;s balanced by the high-flying action this hero, in particular, thrives on. Included are an Eisner winner for best single issue, in which Daredevil must lead a group of blind children through a freezing wilderness; a team up with Spider-Man and heated romance with the Black Cat; and a capper detailing the desperate battle to recover the remains of Daredevil&#x2019;s father from the subterranean Mole Man. Waid begins to darken the narrative palette and entwine plot threads from the first collection while honoring the character&#x2019;s Silver Age heritage with a light touch and an ability to make each episode satisfying in its own right. Art chores are broken up over a wider range of talents here, which makes the overall package feel a touch less cohesive, but each draftsman is highly talented at portraying exposition and action with the right degree of emotional investment and tension. Superhero books simply do not get much better than this. --Jesse Karp</p><h2>Hitler V2023</h2><p>Slight shelf and edge wear.

Long overshadowed by the complexity of her family life and romantic entanglements as a member of the famed Bloomsbury Group, this collection reconsiders Bell in the context of her relationship with her famous sister, Virginia Woolf, and as muse and confidant to Roger Fry and Duncan Grant - but ultimately as an intrepid artist, deserving of fresh consideration for her artistic genius in her own right. &#34;Inventing a new language of visual expression,&#34; Bell&#39;s work as an innovative abstractionist is included here, when she experimented in the form decades before it would first get shown in London, and was among the first abstractionists in Europe at the time. Her ground-breaking feminism emerges in her extensive post-Impressionistic work, with her many female subjects and forms detailed throughout the book. What emerges is a collection of work that shows Bell was as radically innovative in the visual arts as her renowned sister was in the literary arts. Each chapter features essays or excerpts from a range of writers, including: Frances Spalding, Hana Leaper, Grace Brockington, Regina Marler, Christopher Reed, Darren Clarke, Virginia Woolf, Julian Bell, Corin Sworn, and Richard Shone. A short chapter called &#34;Legacy&#34; closes the book, and features photographs by famed rocker and photographer Patti Smith, a devoted follower of the artist who often photographed Vanessa Bell&#39;s works and Charleston, Bell&#39;s home in Sussex.</p><p><p>Frances Spalding is an art historian, critic and biographer, and a leading authority on Bloomsbury. She wrote an introduction to the subject, The Bloomsbury Group, for the National Portrait Gallery's Companion series, and has written biographies of Roger Fry, Duncan Grant, Gwen Raverat and of the poet Stevie Smith, as well as Vanessa Bell. For ten years she edited the Charleston Magazine.

The 300 recipes for early-20th-century farm foods (e.g., baked beans) and details of cold-packing beef, for one, make the book a useful historic document. But Fritz's refashioning of her mother's memories into modern, prosaic sentences robs Hendrickson of an authentic voice. She also makes little effort to divine the larger meaning of Hendrickson's life; while full of recollection, the volume is not big on reflection. Whatever artistry Fritz displays comes from her immersion in minutiae--the proportion of flat to upright corn cobs in a basket of corn cob kindling, or the polishing of an enamel stove with waxed bread wrappers. Emotional moments arise not from the writing but from the unexpected recognition of forgotten phrases on the page--"White House Cake," "Never-Fail Chocolate Frosting." <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Slave No More: Two Men Who Escaped to Freedom, Including Their Own Narratives of Emancipation</h2><p>Slave narratives, some of the most powerful records of our past, are extremely rare, with only fifty-five post&#x2013;Civil War narratives surviving. A mere handful are first-person accounts by slaves who ran away and freed themselves. Now two newly uncovered narratives, and the biographies of the men who wrote them, join that exclusive group with the publication of A Slave No More, a major new addition to the canon of American history. Handed down through family and friends, these narratives tell gripping stories of escape: Through a combination of intelligence, daring, and sheer luck, the men reached the protection of the occupying Union troops. David W. Blight magnifies the drama and significance by prefacing the narratives with each man&#x2019;s life history. Using a wealth of genealogical information, Blight has reconstructed their childhoods as sons of white slaveholders, their service as cooks and camp hands during the Civil War, and their climb to black working-class stability in the north, where they reunited their families. <p></p>In the stories of Turnage and Washington, we find history at its most intimate, portals that offer a rich new answer to the question of how four million people moved from slavery to freedom. In A Slave No More, the untold stories of two ordinary men take their place at the heart of the American experience. <p></p></p><p><b>WALLACE TURNAGE</b> (1846&#x2013;1916) was born in Snow Hill, North Carolina, and spent his adult life in New York City and Jersey City, New Jersey.<p></p><b>JOHN WASHINGTON</b> (1838&#x2013;1918), born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, worked as a house and sign painter in Washington, D.C., after his escape.

Washington was born a slave on May 20, 1838, in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Washington begins his narrative with the wry comment that he &#x201c;never had the pleasure of knowing&#x201d; his mother&#x2019;s owner, Thomas R. Ware, Sr., who died before John was born. And he supposes &#x201c;It might have been a doubtful pleasure.&#x201d; So far as can be determined, Washington also never knew his father, though we can assume he was white. As an autobiographer reconstructing his own youthful identity, Washington says revealingly: &#x201c;I see myself a small light haired boy (very often passing easily for a white boy).&#x201d;1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these words Washington recollects the complicated story of so many American slaves&#x2014;mixed racial heritage. The offspring of sexual unions between black women and their white male owners or pursuers suffered a legacy of confusion, shame, and abuse, but they also occasionally benefited from economic and social advantages, especially in towns and cities. Washington was one of more than 400,000 out of four million American slaves by 1860 who were officially categorized as &#x201c;mulatto&#x201d; or other terminology to distinguish a person of some white parentage. From 1830 to the Civil War, the state of Virginia especially had gone to great effort, although unsuccessfully in practical terms, to legally establish a color line marking who was white and who was not.2 White friends, and perhaps relatives, aided John&#x2019;s education and opportunities early in his life. But in Fredericksburg and elsewhere, due to his mother&#x2019;s status and color, he was considered a chattel slave until the war came.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly who Washington&#x2019;s father was, and how John got his middle initial and last name, have been impossible to trace. A John M. Washington, a distant cousin of President George Washington, lived in Fredericksburg, went to West Point in the 1810s, became an artillery officer, and died in a shipwreck in 1853. But no evidence exists for his patrimony of John. Ware had four sons by 1838, ages twenty-six, twenty-four, twenty, and eighteen. Any of them could have been Washington&#x2019;s father, although only the two younger ones, John and William, seem to have been residents of Fredericksburg at the time.3<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington&#x2019;s story is much clearer on his mother&#x2019;s side. Women determined, protected, and supported John&#x2019;s life chances. His maternal grandmother was a slave named Molly who was born in the late 1790s and owned by Thomas Ware. Molly, called &#x201c;my Negro woman,&#x201d; is acknowledged for her &#x201c;faithful service&#x201d; in Ware&#x2019;s 1820 will, in which he bequeathed her and her children (valued at $600) to his wife, Catherine (who would eventually be John&#x2019;s owner). By 1825 Ware&#x2019;s estate inventory lists Molly and four children; John&#x2019;s mother, Sarah, was the oldest at age eight. Molly would have another four children by the 1830s. In June of 1829 this strong-willed mother misbehaved (perhaps running away) in such a manner that Catherine Ware arranged with a punishment house to execute a &#x201c;warrant against Molly and for whipping her by contract $1.34.&#x201d;4 Perhaps Molly&#x2019;s defiance was sparked because her sister, Alice, had just been sold away for $350.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can only imagine the sorrow and scars in Molly&#x2019;s psyche, a woman whose life was spent nursing white children as well as her own and serving the extended Ware family. But she would live to join her grandson on their flight to freedom in 1862. She died a free woman near her daughter, grandson, and great grandchildren. Whether she departed as a sad or a joyful matriarch, John Washington does not tell us. His silence about Molly may reflect that he was telling only his own heroic story, which did not allow for his grandmother&#x2019;s saga, but it could also represent a part of his family history he was not prepared to expose.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah Tucker, John&#x2019;s mother, was likely born in January 1817. Who the men fathering all these children were remains a researcher&#x2019;s mystery. Sarah probably also had a white father; she is described in various documents as being &#x201c;bright mulatto&#x201d; and short in height.5 Ware did not own any men who could have been either Sarah&#x2019;s or John&#x2019;s father. When Sarah gave birth to John in 1838, she was a twenty-one-year-old who had somehow learned to read and write, a less unusual accomplishment for urban slaves in small households than for plantation slaves.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1832, when Sarah was a teenager, Catherine Ware married Francis Whitaker Taliaferro, a plantation and slave owner with four grown children. The Taliaferros had their own slaves and hired others when they needed extra hands, as was the common practice; in 1836 Mr. Taliaferro advertised for &#x201c;ten able-bodied men for the remainder of the year,&#x201d; offering twelve dollars per month to their owners. The Taliaferros also hired out their own slaves on occasion, including Sarah. With John in tow, Sarah was hired out in 1840 to a farm thirty-seven miles west of Fredericksburg, owned by Richard L. Brown of Orange County.6<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington yearningly describes his eight years in the countryside in the idyllic opening section of his narrative. His mother must have worked as a house slave because he played &#x201c;mostly with white children.&#x201d; He spent summers &#x201c;wading the brooks&#x201d; and climbing ridges from which he could see the &#x201c;Blue Ridge Mountains&#x201d; and a &#x201c;moss covered wheel . . . throwing the water off in beautiful showers&#x201d; at a mill on the Rapidan River. Among these pleasant memories is his going to a circus at Orange Court House, where he got lost from his family, and his attending services with his mother at the &#x201c;Mount Pisgah&#x201d; Baptist church, a large structure &#x201c;with gallerys around for colored people to sit in.&#x201d; John loved the &#x201c;tall pines&#x201d; that surrounded the church and remembers the &#x201c;cakes, candy and fruits&#x201d; sold under the great trees on Sundays. He relished his recollections of &#x201c;corn shuckings,&#x201d; a &#x201c;hog killing,&#x201d; and a joyous Christmas celebration. He also remembered his mother teaching him the child&#x2019;s bedtime prayer, &#x201c;Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;Lord&#x2019;s Prayer.&#x201d; And perhaps most important, by the time he was eight, Sarah had taught him the alphabet.7<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equipped with literacy, if not with good spelling or grammar, Washington brilliantly uses all of these images of nature as backdrop for his descent into the hell of slavery. He employs natural beauty as a metaphor for freedom and a reminder of the terror of bondage, knowing that the glories of nature can both inspire the soul and mock human sadness. He worries at one point that his &#x201c;minute events&#x201d; would not &#x201c;interest&#x201d; his reader, and then he quickly moves his story forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These early years were both easy and painful for Washington to remember. He likely had no memory, though, of his mother&#x2019;s attempt to run away when he was only three. On February 19, 1841, Thomas R. Ware, Jr., advertised in a Fredericksburg newspaper for a &#x201c;negro woman sarah.&#x201d; She is described as &#x201c;about 20 years of age, a bright Mulatto, and rather under the common size.&#x201d; Clearly she had fled some distance and for some length of time, because the notice offered a twenty-dollar reward if Sarah was captured &#x201c;more than 20 miles from this place.&#x201d;8 No evidence survives to indicate how and when Sarah was captured or why she fled. Perhaps she simply took flight from the pressures of daily life for a while. Perhaps she was a young, disgruntled woman &#x201c;lying out,&#x201d; as the saying went, absconding to the woods or another farm to be with her lover. But she was surely a woman of unusual intelligence and resourcefulness if she managed to escape and remain on her own for a period of time.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent study of runaway slaves in the antebellum South found that slaveholders&#x2019; advertisements often described a slave as &#x201c;proud, artful, cunning . . . shrewd&#x201d; or &#x201c;very smart.&#x201d; Historians Loren Schweninger and John Hope Franklin conclude that the typical runaway exhibited &#x201c;self-confidence, self-assurance, self-possession . . . self-reliance.&#x201d; It was rare for women to run away, especially those with small children. In the database produced by Schweninger and Franklin, based on extant runaway advertisements in five Southern states, 81 percent of all runaways were male. Of the 195 Virginia runaways from 1838 to 1860, of which Sarah would be one, only seventeen (9 percent) were female.9<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah likely never told her son the story of her flight, although he eventually might have learned of it from others. That Washington had a mother who herself had been a runaway provided a deep layer of silent inheritance, embedded in his spirit if not in his memory. No doubt, both John&#x2019;s mother and grandmother kept parts of their own physical, emotional, and...</p><h2>Romeo and Juliet (Picture This!

They are the centers of capital accumulation as well as of revolutionary politics, where deeper currents of social and political change rise to the surface.

Listings for countries of the world H through I can be found in Vol. 3B. Collectors of Great Britain will want to scrutinize the postage, Machin head, and booklets listings. An exhaustive review of these sections resulted in more than 9,300 value changes. One bright spot is an increase in values for used commemorative stamps issued from early 2001 through 2016, an acknowledgment that demand is on the rise and dealer stocks are not plentiful. Values for booklet panes and complete booklets have been thoroughly reviewed and updated to reflect current market conditions. For selected modern booklets (prestige booklets, in particular), values now reflect the market values for the key pane or stamp found only in the booklet. An expanded editorial note at the beginning of the booklets section provides more detail.</p><p>The Scott Catalogue of postage stamps, published by Scott Publishing Co, is updated annually with hundreds of thousands of changes and lists all the stamps of the entire world . From its humble beginning as a 24-page bound pamphlet, the multi-volume set now list more than 700,000 stamps from 600 different postal entities. Because of the size of each Volume, the 2019 edition has each volume split into a part A and B. So when purchasing you are obtaining the volume set of part 3A and 3B. Scott Publishing publishes a total of eight large volumes that include six volumes containing all the countries of the world, the United States Specialized Catalog, and the 1840-1940 Classic Specialized Catalogue (covering the world for the first 100 years that stamps were issued).

The message of the book, to learn to appreciate rather than dislike other people's differences, is conveyed Limburger-strong (and just as cheesy) through the unremarkable rhyming text. The illustrator uses a cartoonish, faux-childlike style and a cross-hatched layering technique to create pictures that are busy rather than vivid. The lack of borders and use of matte paper make them appear crammed into the pages. The colors (especially an overused Pepto-Bismol pink and a ruined-in-the-laundry white) are distracting.

One of the world&#39;s biggest and most successful banks, its downfall was the event that sparked the slide of the world economy toward a Great Depression II. This is the gripping inside story of the dark characters who ruled Lehman, who refused to heed warnings that the company was headed for an iceberg; the world-class, mid-level people who valiantly fought to get Lehman off its disastrous course; and, the crash that didn&#39;t have to happen. This is a news-breaking explanation that answers the question everyone still asks: &#39;why did it happen&#39;? Larry McDonald, a former vice-president at Lehman Brothers in charge of distressed debt trading and convertible securities, was right at the centre of the meltdown of the company and gives an intimate look at the madhouse that Lehman became. This book shows beyond a doubt that Richard Fuld, the long-time CEO of Lehman, and his top executives, were totally out to lunch, allowing Lehman&#39;s risk profile to reach gargantuan proportions. While the traders, like Larry McDonald, clearly predicted more than two years in advance that the market for packaged subprime mortgages and credit default swaps would evaporate, the high-flying Lehman bosses pushed hard on the gas pedal until the very end.</p><p>Lawrence G. McDonald was, until 2008, Vice President of convertible securities and distressed debt trading at Lehman Brothers; his prior career included convertible securities research and sales at Morgan Stanley and the co-founding of Convertbond.com, named by Forbes Magazine as &#34;Best of the Web.&#34; Patrick Robinson is the co-author of LONE SURVIVOR and author of many tech-thrillers.<b>Prologue </b><br> &nbsp;<br> I still live just a few city blocks away from the old Lehman Brothers <br> headquarters at 745 Seventh Avenue&#x2014;six blocks, and about ten <br> thousand years. I still walk past it two or three times a week, and each <br> time I try to look forward, south toward Wall Street. And I always resolve <br> to keep walking, glancing neither left nor right, locking out the <br> memories. But I always stop. <br> &nbsp;<br> And I see again the light blue livery of Barclays Capital, which <br> represents&#x2014;for me, at least&#x2014;the flag of an impostor, a pale substitute <br> for the swashbuckling banner that for 158 years was slashed above the <br> entrance to the greatest merchant bank Wall Street ever knew: <br> Lehman Brothers. <br> &nbsp;<br> It was only the fourth largest. But its traditions were those of a <br> banking warrior&#x2014;the brilliant finance house that had backed, encouraged, <br> and made possible the retail giants Gimbel Brothers, F. W. <br> Woolworth, and Macy&#x2019;s, and the airlines American, National, TWA, <br> and Pan American. They raised the capital for Campbell Soup Company, <br> the Jewel Tea Company, B. F. Goodrich. And they backed the <br> birth of television at RCA, plus the Hollywood studios RKO, Paramount, <br> and 20th Century Fox. They found the money for the Trans-<br> Canada oil pipeline. <br> &nbsp;<br> I suppose, in a sense, I had seen only its demise, the four-year <br> death rattle of twenty-first-century finance, which ended on September <br> 15, 2008. Yet in my mind, I remember the great days. And as I <br> come to a halt outside the building, I know too that in the next few <br> moments I will be engulfed by sadness. But I always stop. <br> &nbsp;<br> And I always stare up at the third floor, where once I worked as a <br> trader on one of the toughest trading floors on earth. And then I find <br> myself counting all the way up to thirty-one, the floor where it all went so catastrophically wrong, the floor that housed the royal court of King <br> Richard. That&#x2019;s Richard S. Fuld, chairman and CEO. <br> &nbsp;<br> Swamped by nostalgia, edged as we all are by a lingering anger, <br> and still plagued by unanswerable questions, I stand and stare upward, <br> sorrowful beyond reason, and trapped by the twin words of those possessed <br> of flawless hindsight: if only. <br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes I lie awake at night trying to place all the if-onlys in <br> some kind of order. Sometimes the order changes, and sometimes <br> there is a new leader, one single aspect of the Lehman collapse that <br> stands out above all others. But it&#x2019;s never clear. Except when I stand <br> right here and look up at the great glass fortress which once housed <br> Lehman, and focus on that thirty-first floor. Then it&#x2019;s clear. Boy, is it <br> ever clear. And the phrase if only slams into my brain. <br> &nbsp;<br> If only they had listened&#x2014;Dick Fuld and his president, Joe Gregory. <br> Three times they were hit with the irredeemable logic of three of <br> the cleverest financial brains on Wall Street&#x2014;those of Mike Gelband, <br> our global head of fixed income, Alex Kirk, global head of distressed <br> trading research and sales, and Larry McCarthy, head of distressed-<br> bond trading. <br> &nbsp;<br> Each and every one of them laid it out, from way back in 2005, <br> that the real estate market was living on borrowed time and that <br> Lehman Brothers was headed directly for the biggest subprime iceberg <br> ever seen, and with the wrong men on the bridge. Dick and Joe <br> turned their backs all three times. It was probably the worst triple <br> since St. Peter denied Christ. <br> &nbsp;<br> Beyond that, there were six more if-onlys, each one as cringemakingly <br> awful as the last. <br> &nbsp;<br> If only Chairman Fuld had kept his ear close to the ground on <br> the inner workings of his firm&#x2014;both its triumphs and its mistakes. If <br> he had listened to his generals, met people who formed the heart and <br> soul of Lehman Brothers, the catastrophe might have been avoided. <br> But instead of this, he secluded himself in his palatial offices up there <br> on the thirty-first floor, remote from the action, dreaming only of accelerating <br> growth, nursing ambitions far removed from reality. <br> &nbsp;<br> If only the secret coup against Fuld and Gregory had taken place <br> months before that clandestine meeting in June 2008. If the eleven <br> managing directors who sat in ostensibly treasonous but ultimately <br> loyal comradeship that night had acted sooner and removed the Lehman leaders, they might have steadied the ship, changing its course. <br> &nbsp;<br> If only the reign of terror that drove out the most brilliant of <br> Lehman&#x2019;s traders and risk takers had been halted earlier, perhaps in <br> the name of common sense. The top managers might have marshaled <br> their forces immediately when they saw giants such as Mike Gelband <br> being ignored. <br> &nbsp;<br> If only Dick Fuld had kept his anger, resentment, and rudeness <br> under control. Especially at that private dinner in the spring of 2008 <br> with Hank Paulson, secretary of the United States Treasury. That was <br> when Fuld&#x2019;s years of smoldering envy of Goldman Sachs came cascading <br> to the surface and caused Paulson to leave furious that the <br> Lehman boss had disrespected the office he held. Perhaps that was <br> the moment Hank decided he could not bring himself to bail out the <br> bank controlled by Richard S. Fuld. <br> &nbsp;<br> If only President George W. Bush had taken the final, desperate <br> call from Fuld&#x2019;s office, a call made by his own cousin, George Walker <br> IV, in the night hours before the bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. <br> It might have made a difference. <br> &nbsp;<br> If only . . . if only. Those two words haunt my dreams. I go back <br> to the fall of Lehman, and what might have made things different. For <br> most people, victims or not of this worldwide collapse of the financial <br> markets, it will be, in time, just water over the dam. But it will never <br> be that for me, and my long background as a trader and researcher has <br> prompted me many times to burrow down further to the bedrock, the <br> cause of the crash of 2008. I refer to the repeal of the Glass-Steagall <br> Act in 1999. <br> &nbsp;<br> If only President Clinton had never signed the bill repealing <br> Glass-Steagall. Personally, I never thought he much wanted to sign it, <br> but to understand the ramifications it is necessary to delve deeper, and <br> before I begin my story, I will present you with some critical background <br> information, without which your grasp might be incomplete. <br> It&#x2019;s a ten-minute meadow of wisdom and hindsight, the sort of thing I <br> tend to specialize in. <br> &nbsp;<br> The story begins in the heady, formative years of the Clinton presidency on a rose-colored quest to change the world, to help the poor, and ended in the poisonous heartland of world financial disaster. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Roberta Achtenberg, the daughter of a Russian-born owner of a <br> Los Angeles neighborhood grocery store, was plucked by President <br> Clinton from relative obscurity in 1993 and elevated to the position of <br> assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. <br> Roberta and Bill were united in their desire to increase home <br> ownership in poor and minority communities. <br> &nbsp;<br> And despite a barrage of objections led by Senator Jesse Helms, <br> who referred to Achtenberg as that &#x201c;damn lesbian,&#x201d; the lady took up <br> her appointment in the new administration, citing innate racism as <br> one of the main reasons why banks were reluctant to lend to those <br> without funds. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the ensuing couple of years, Roberta Achtenberg harnessed all <br> of the formidable energy on the massed ranks of United States <br> bankers, sometimes threatening, sometimes berating, sometimes <br> bullying&#x2014;anything to persuade the banks to provide mortgages to people <br> who might not have been up to the challenge of coping with up-<br> front down payments and regular monthly payments. <br> &nbsp;<br> Between 1993 and 1999, more than two million such clients became <br> new homeowners. In her two-year tenure as assistant secretary, <br> she set up a national grid of offices staffed by attorneys and investigators. <br> Their principal aim was to enforce the laws against the banks, the <br> laws that dealt with discrimination. Some of the fines leveled at banks <br> ran into the millions, to drive home Achtenberg&#x2019;s avowed intent to utilize <br> the law to change the ethos of providing mortgage money in the <br> United States of America. <br> &nbsp;<br> Banks were compelled to jump into line, and soon they were <br> making thousands of loans without any cash-down deposits whatsoever, <br> an unprecedented situation. Mortgage officers inside the banks <br> were forced to bend or break their own rules in order to achieve a good <br> Community Reinvestment Act rating, which would please the administration <br> by demonstrating generosity to underprivileged borrowers <br> even if they might default. Easy mortgages were the invention of Bill <br> Clinton&#x2019;s Democrats. <br> &nbsp;<br> However, there was, in the mid- to late 1990s, one enormous advantage: <br> amid general prosperity, the housing market was strong and <br> prices were rising steadily. At that point in time, mortgage defaults <br> were relatively few in number and the securitization of mortgages, which had such disastrous consequences during the financial crisis that began in 2007, barely existed. <br> &nbsp;<br> Nonetheless, there were many beady-eyed financiers who looked <br> askance at this new morality and privately yearned for the days when <br> bank policies were strictly conservative, when credit was flatly denied <br> to anyone without the proven ability to repay. <br> &nbsp;<br> And at the center of this seething disquiet, somewhere between <br> the persuasive silken-tongued members of the banking lobby and the <br> missionary zeal of Roberta Achtenberg, stood William J. Clinton, <br> whose heart, not for the first time, may have been ruling his head. <br> &nbsp;<br> He understood full well the goodwill he had engendered in the <br> new home-owning black and Hispanic communities. But he could not <br> fail to heed the very senior voices of warning that whispered, There <br> may be trouble ahead. <br> &nbsp;<br> President Clinton wanted to stay focused with the concerns of <br> the bankers, many of whom were seriously upset by Achtenberg&#x2019;s pressure <br> to provide shaky mortgages. And right before the president&#x2019;s eyes <br> there was a related situation, one that had the deepest possible roots <br> in the American financial community. <br> &nbsp;<br> This was the fabled Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, the post&#x2013;Wall <br> Street crash legislation that prevented commercial banks from merging <br> with investment banks, thus eliminating the opportunity for the <br> high-rolling investment guys to get their hands on limitless supplies of <br> depositors&#x2019; money. Glass-Steagall was nothing short of a barrier, and it <br> stayed in place for more than sixty years, but the major U.S. banks <br> wanted it abolished. They&#x2019;d tried but failed in 1988. It would take another <br> four years for this Depression-era legislation to come once more <br> under attack. <br> &nbsp;<br> President Clinton understood the ramifications, and he was wary <br> of the reform, wary of seeming to be allied with the power brokers of <br> the biggest banks in the country. He understood the complexities of <br> the Glass-Steagall Act, its origins, and its purposes&#x2014;principally to <br> prevent some diabolical investment house from plunging in big on a <br> corporation like Enron and going down with a zillion dollars of small <br> depositors&#x2019; cash. No part of that did President Bill need. <br> &nbsp;<br> On one hand was the belief of the main U.S. clearing banks that <br> such mergers would strengthen the whole financial industry by increasing <br> opportunities for hefty profits. But there were many people <br> running small banks who were fearful that a repeal of Glass-Steagall <br> would ultimately lead to large conglomerates crushing the life out of <br> the minnows. <br> &nbsp;<br> President Clinton always kept a weather eye on history, and he <br> was aware the commercial banks, with their overenthusiastic investments <br> in the stock market, had essentially taken the rap for the crash <br> of 1929. They were accused of crossing a forbidden line, of buying <br> stock in corporations for resale to the public. It had been too risky, and <br> the pursuit of huge profits had clouded their judgment. <br> &nbsp;<br> The man who had stood firmly in the path of the gathering storm <br> of the 1930s was Virginia senator Carter Glass, a former treasury secretary <br> and the founder of the U.S. Federal Reserve System. The somewhat <br> stern Democratic newspaper proprietor was determined that the commercial <br> banks and the investment banks should be kept forever apart. <br> &nbsp;<br> He was supported by the chairman of the House Banking and <br> Currency Committee, Alabama congressman Henry Bascom Steagall, <br> and it was their rigid legal barricade that did much to solve Wall <br> Street&#x2019;s greatest-ever crisis. The biggest banks were thenceforth prevented <br> from speculating heavily in the stock markets. But even then, a <br> lot of people thought it was a harsh and restrictive law. <br> &nbsp;<br> With President Clinton in office for only three years, the major <br> banks once more marshaled their forces to try for a third time to repeal <br> Glass-Steagall, and once more it all came to nothing, with the nation&#x2019;s <br> small banks fighting tooth and nail to hold back a system they thought <br> might engulf them. But in 1996 they failed once more. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the early spring of 1998, however, a Wall Street detonator exploded, <br> sending a sharp signal that the market was willing to go it <br> alone despite the politicians.

It doesn&#39;t fly to the next state for twigs or build a bigger home than it needs. Instinctively it creates an environment that is nurturing and nontoxic. Like the bird, humans desire shelter that is cozy and nurturing, that satisfies the soul, mind, and body. This is what you find when you step into an econest. Beginning with a timberframe structure and walls created with a mix of clay and straw, EcoNest: Creating Sustainable Sanctuaries of Clay, Straw, and Timber describes a unique method of green building that avoids the typical problems involved with conventional building, such as industrial waste, excessive chemical usage, and inefficient synthetic insulation. Design details such as which direction a home is oriented, what kind of lighting illuminates each room, and whether or not there is a step-down entryway are a vital part of creating each econest. Meet the homeowners of ten different econests around the country in regions as diverse as Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico, and California who chose to build in appreciation of the harmony and beauty of nature, using nature&#39;s resources so as to consume less energy, create less waste, nurture their health, and enrich their senses. EcoNest invites you to experience a healthy and sustainable kind of building, avoid the pitfalls of modern homes and acute chemical sensitivity, and to live simply, in harmony with nature.

There are few people more qualified to lead a reader, as he does in <i>The Last Party,</i> past the velvet ropes and doorman and into the tornado of 1970s disco, drug excess, and excessive sex that was Studio 54. Unlike some of his contemporaries whose memories are dulled by years of hard living, Haden-Guest seems to actually recall many of his experiences at Studio. His book is therefore part personal memoir, part reportage. <p> The cast of characters includes Andy, Liza, Halston, and Bianca--no last names needed--and other luminaries etched into Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager's exclusive guest list. The anecdotes include lurid details of the revelry and stories like the one about that Halloween when two Lady Godivas were kept outside but their horse was allowed in. Haden-Guest resists the obvious urge to dish too much about the stars and instead examines the club as a social phenomenon. In his book, the front door of Studio 54 swings open just long enough to let escape the shadow of a scene that's long since seen the light of day.</p>Studio 54 was the icon of excesses. It was the cradle of today's culture of celebrity, a place were Liza, Mick, and Andy lounged in the VIP section while revelers did drugs in the fabled unisex bathroom, and would-be revelers waited hour after hour on West Fifty-fourth Street, hoping to catch the eye of a nineteen-year-old-doorman who was, for a brief moment, the ultimate gatekeeper of cool. <p>The Last Party is the story not just of Studio 54 but of the whole Nightworld. Anthony Haden-Guest was on this scene at the opening night party and many nights thereafter. He knew all the key players and has interviewed everyone, from the stars and club kids who made the scene to the impresarios who created it to the cops who ultimately brought it down. He takes us past the velvet cord, down onto the pounding dance floor, up into the polymorphously perverse balcony, and on into Steve Rubell's office, where a few insiders stuffed cash into garbage bags as they skimmed millions from their golden goose. He shows us the after-hours clubs, the seamy underbelly of New York nightlife, and the ever-more-violent aftermath of the world that Studio 54 launched with such flash. Vivid, nonstop, and revealing, The Last Party is as packed with sparkle, scandal, and celebrity as Studio itself.</p></p><h2>The Day After Tomorrow</h2><p>As an American surgeon tries to kill the man who murdered his father and a Geneva medical resident begins a fateful love affair, a group of industrialists prepares for a momentous celebration. 300,000 first printing.

This volume, collected by award-winning author Michael Rosen, presents a glorious selection of classic poetry, chronologically arranged from the seventeenth century to modern day&#x2014;poems by such celebrated poets as William Shakespeare, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Emily Dickinson, Carl Sandburg, and Langston Hughes&#x2014; complete with biographical sketches of the poets, information on individual poems, and notes on poetic forms. Paul Howard's full-color illustrations illuminate some of the most brilliant poems of the English-speaking world with stunning breadth and beauty. A book to be treasured, Classic Poetry belongs on every shelf&#x2014;every child should know these poems and keep this book with them as they grow.</p><p>In so many classic poetry selections, you'll find old favorites, but no information on the creators themselves. In Michael Rosen's hearty, well-designed, 160-page anthology--with strikingly diverse illustrations by the talented and chameleonic artist Paul Howard--readers will find a portrait and short biography of each poet accompanying his or her work. Not only that but the selections are arranged chronologically, from the 17th century to the modern day. William Shakespeare's "All the World's a Stage" from <i>As You Like It</i> begins the classic collection, then readers are introduced to William Blake, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Edward Lear, Emily Dickinson, Lewis Carroll, Langston Hughes, and many, many more. Poet, storyteller, broadcaster, and children's book author Rosen says of his treasury, "There are so many ways to enjoy poems. This book is a way of offering new insights into poems, poets, and the relationships between them. It also offers a springboard to children and adults wanting to find out more and explore the world of poetry." And illustrator Howard should take a bow for his successful efforts to explore different techniques and artwork styles that complement the moods and historical context of each poem so perfectly. We welcome the chance to revisit Lear's "The Jumblies," Longfellow's "Paul Revere's Ride," and other well-loved poems in such a beautiful package. (Ages 9 and older)Paul Howard decided that his portraits would show the poets to be as young as possible without depicting them as children. The idea, he says, was to demonstrate "that you don't have to be a wrinkly old man to be a poet. It's a common image, but I wanted to make these poets an inspiration to young people, to show that you can be a poet at any age."<br><br>Michael Rosen says, "The idea behind this book is to show that great poems have been written by real people who lived in their own time and in their own place &#x2014; and to offer new insights into poems, poets, and the relationships between them. It offers a springboard to children and adults wanting to find out more and explore the world of poetry."</p><h2>The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity</h2><p>The conversion of the pagan world that began in the obscurity of the Dark Ages was in no way inevitable. England did not embrace Christianity until 627, and while confessing communities existed from Greenland to China by the millennium, the last European conversion occurred late in the Middle Ages, in 1386. How did it all happen--and why? In a work of splid scholarship that often reads like a detective story and that owes as much to keen intuition as to the mastery of difficult sources, Richard Fletcher lays out the story of the Christianization of Europe. It is a very large story, for conversion was not merely a matter of religious belief. Christianity brought with it enormous cultural baggage. With it came Latin literacy--books; Roman notions of law, property, and government--even the concept of town life, and Mediterranean customs, including new tastes in food, drink, and dress. Whether from faith or by force, conversion had an immense impact that is with us even today, and it is Richard Fletcher's achievement to make that impact felt and understood.<br></p><p>"It is a wholly deplorable state of affairs when specialists in any discipline talk only to each other," writes Richard Fletcher. And, indeed, he has brought to his new work the same uncommon narrative flair and respect for sources found in Moorish Spain and The Search for El Cid, winner of both the Wolfson Prize and the Los Angeles Times History Prize.<br>An elegant history of the Christianization of northwestern Europe. Not many historians would be willing to tackle a subject that encompasses more than 1,000 years of history, several discrete cultures, and numerous religious systems, or that requires a mastery of sparse resources written in several languages no longer extant. Then again, Fletcher (whose 1990 The Quest for El Cid won the Los Angeles Times history prize) is no ordinary historian. He bucks the trend of postwar historical specialization by writing a ``grand'' narrative tracing the rise of Latin Christianity not just in his native England (though this is the most normative case study in the book, to which he constantly refers), but also Spain, France, Germany, and Ireland, among many others. Scandinavia (including Greenland and Iceland) is also included, offering a much needed contribution to the history of western Christendom. The author concludes by recounting Western Christianity's push into eastern Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the increasing emphasis on war (``crusade'') as a justified means to convert the heathen abroad. Fletcher's comprehensive, comparative technique is fruitful; he is mindful that the introduction of Christianity into these various regions necessitated not just a transformation of belief, but also an adoption of foreign cultural practices such as Roman government, dress, and food, as well as an emphasis on literacy. Throughout, Fletcher raises provocative questions about the motives for Christian evangelism, as well as the nature of conversion itself: At what point can historians claim that an entire culture was ``converted'' to a particular religion? Fletcher is an even-handed, creative historian. Well written and engaging, his book stands as a uniquely ambitious metahistory. His suggestions for further reading provide direction for more focused inquiry. (36 b&amp;w photos, 10 maps, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

His books have been translated into more than twenty languages and many titles have become classics. Ernst Gombrich was born in Vienna and came to England in 1936. He spent the larger part of his working life at the University of London&#39;s Warburg Institute, where he was Director from 1959 until his retirement in 1976. His &#39;retirement&#39; saw the publication of numerous books, reviews, and articles, and the conferring of many international honors, including a knighthood and the Order of Merit. In 1994 the city of Frankfurt awarded him the Goethe Prize. Professor Gombrich&#39;s books are models of good art-historical writing, and reflect his deep and abiding concern with the standards and values of our cultural heritage.</p><h2>Keys to the Deeper Life</h2><p>Although never considered to be a popular speaker nor prolific writer, A. W. Tozer&#39;s audiences did appreciate what he had to say, and he was probably the most widely read Christian writer of his time. Keys to the Deeper Life contains six of his best-known essays and editorials. In them he rigorously examines many of the failings and foibles of his day. Although most were written more than three decades ago, the insights they offer are as fresh and thought-provoking as the day they were published. Robert Walker, the editor of Christian Life, and a long-time associate of Tozer, has written an Introduction to the book that delightfully captures Tozer&#39;s irascible genius. Keys to the Deeper Life also contains the account of an exclusive interview with A. W. Tozer shortly before his death.</p><p>The late Dr. A. W. Tozer was well known in evangelical circles both for his long and fruitful editorship of the Alliance Witness as well as his pastorate of one of the largest Alliance churches in the Chicago area. He came to be known as the Prophet of Today because of his penetrating books on the deeper spiritual life.CHAPTER ONE Leaning into the Wind Wherever Christians meet these days one word is sure to be heard constantly repeated; that word is revival. In sermon, song and prayer we are forever reminding the Lord and each other that what we must have to solve all our spiritual problems is a &#39;mighty, old-time revival.&#39; The religious press, too, has largely gone over to the proposition that revival is the one great need of the hour, and anyone who is capable of preparing a brief for revival is sure to find many editors who will publish it. So strongly is the breeze blowing for revival that scarcely anyone appears to have the discernment or the courage to turn around and lean into the wind, even though the truth may easily lie in that direction. Religion has its vogues very much as do philosophy, politics and women&#39;s fashions. Historically the major world religions have had their periods of decline and recovery, and those recoveries are bluntly called revivals by the annalists. Let us not forget that in some lands Islam is now enjoying a revival, and the latest report from Japan indicates that after a brief eclipse following World War II Shintoism is making a remarkable come-back. In our own country Roman Catholicism as well as liberal Protestantism is moving forward at such a rate that the word &#39;revival&#39; is almost necessary to describe the phenomenon. And this without any perceptible elevation of the moral standards of its devotees. A religion, even popular Christianity, could enjoy a boom altogether divorced from the transforming power of the Holy Spirit and so leave the church of the next generation worse off than it would have been if the boom had never occurred. I believe that the imperative need of the day is not simply revival, but a radical reformation that will go to the root of our moral and spiritual maladies and deal with causes rather than with consequences, with the disease rather than with symptoms. It is my considered opinion that under the present circumstances we do not want revival at all. A widespread revival of the kind of Christianity we know today in America might prove to be a moral tragedy from which we would not recover in a hundred years. Here are my reasons. A generation ago, as a reaction from Higher Criticism and its offspring, Modernism, there arose in Protestantism a powerful movement in defense of the historic Christian faith. This, for obvious reasons, came to be known as Fundamentalism. It was a more or less spontaneous movement without much organization, but its purpose wherever it appeared was the same: to stay &#39;the rising tide of negation&#39; in Christian theology and to restate and defend the basic doctrines of New Testament Christianity. This much is history. Falls Victim to Its Virtues What is generally overlooked is that Fundamentalism, as it spread throughout the various denominations and nondenominational groups, fell victim to its own virtues. The Word died in the hands of its friends. Verbal inspiration, for instance (a doctrine which I have always held and do now hold), soon became afflicted with rigor mortis. The voice of the prophet was silenced and the scribe captured the minds of the faithful. In large areas the religious imagination withered. An unofficial hierarchy decided what Christians were to believe. Not the Scriptures, but what the scribe thought the Scriptures meant became the Christian creed. Christian colleges, seminaries, Bible institutes, Bible conferences, popular Bible expositors all joined to promote the cult of textualism. The system of extreme dispensationalism which was devised, relieved the Christian of repentance, obedience and cross-carrying in any other than the most formal sense. Whole sections of the New Testament were taken from the church and disposed of after a rigid system of &#39;dividing the Word of truth.&#39; All this resulted in a religious mentality inimical to the true faith of Christ. A kind of cold mist settled over Fundamentalism. Below, the terrain was familiar. This was New Testament Christianity, to be sure. The basic doctrines of the Bible were there, but the climate was just not favorable to the sweet fruits of the Spirit. The whole mood was different from that of the Early Church and of the great souls who suffered and sang and worshiped in the centuries past. The doctrines were sound but something vital was missing. The tree of correct doctrine was never allowed to blossom. The voice of the turtle [dove] was rarely heard in the land; instead, the parrot sat on his artificial perch and dutifully repeated what he had been taught and the whole emotional tone was somber and dull. Faith, a mighty, vitalizing doctrine in the mouths of the apostles, became in the mouth of the scribe another thing altogether and power went from it. As the letter triumphed, the Spirit withdrew and textualism ruled supreme. It was the time of the believer&#39;s Babylonian captivity. In the interest of accuracy it should be said that this was a general condition only. Certainly there were some even in those low times whose longing hearts were better theologians than their teachers were. These pressed on to a fullness and power unknown to the rest. But they were not many and the odds were too great; they could not dispel the mist that hung over the land. The error of textualism is not doctrinal. It is far more subtle than that and much more difficult to discover, but its effects are just as deadly. Not its theological beliefs are at fault, but its assumptions. It assumes, for instance, that if we have the word for a thing we have the thing itself. If it is in the Bible, it is in us. If we have the doctrine, we have the experience. If something was true of Paul it is of necessity true of us because we accept Paul&#39;s epistles as divinely inspired. The Bible tells us how to be saved, but textualism goes on to make it tell us that we are saved, something which in the very nature of things it cannot do. Assurance of individual salvation is thus no more than a logical conclusion drawn from doctrinal premises, and the resultant experience wholly mental.</p><h2>Ursula K Le Guin: 5 Complete Novels</h2><p>Omnibus of five novels, each originally published separately: Rocannon&#39;s World, Planet of Exile, City of Illusions, The Left Hand of Darkness (winner 1969 Nebula Award, 1970 Hugo Award, 1995 James Tiptree, Jr. Award, Retroactive.

He holds a Ph.D. in human anatomy and his entire academic career was spent at the University of Tennessee, Health Science Center, where he published dozens of papers on wound-healing, and taught microscopic anatomy to thousands of medical and dental students. He lives in Memphis, Tennessee with his wife and two West Highland terriers. In the spring of most years he simply cannot stop buying new flowers and other plants for the couple&#39;s prized backyard garden. He is the author of five medical thrillers and seven forensic mysteries, the latter featuring the hugely overweight and equally brilliant New Orleans medical examiner, Andy Broussard, and his gorgeous psychologist sidekick, Kit Franklyn. Of these it has been said that they contain &#39;lots of Louisiana color, pinpoint plotting and two highly likable characters&#39;, whilst the Los Angeles Times states &#39;the autopsies are detailed enough to make Patricia Cornwell fans move farther south for their forensic fixes . . . . . splendidly eccentric local denizens, authentic New Orleans and bayou backgrounds&#39;.When a series of inexplicable murder-suicides baffles the New Orleans police department, Kit Franklyn, a young psychologist specializing in suicide research, is assigned to the investigation. She uncovers a bizarre set of circumstances: each victim had type O blood, drove an obsolete car manufactured in New Orleans, and hummed a nursery rhyme before murdering someone else and then killing himself. Andy Broussard, the obese, jovial, and shrewd chief medical examiner, works closely with Kit. Their strictly scientific inquiries clash head on with folklore and black magic when an ancient Cajun friend of Broussard reveals the story of Albair Fauquel, accused of sorcery in 1738, who uttered the curse, "Beware the songs you loved in youth," before he was quickly tried and hung. Kit's astute investigative sense leads her to a major industrial complex where the first murder-suicide occurred, and she discovers that the owner has ties to a fabric expert in the police department's forensic unit. What links together the ancient malediction, the police department, and the suicides? Unfortunately this bland first novel by a New Orleans pathologist reveals motive and murderer far too early, leaving the two engaging protagonists to struggle with a lengthy and contrived finale. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad</h2><p>Not since Kliban has there been a cat book this edgy.

Hell was about to be unleashed on them in the largest single-ship kamikaze attack of World War II.</b><br><br>On April 16, 1945, the crewmen of the USS <i>Laffey</i> were battle hardened and prepared. They had engaged in combat off the Normandy coast in June 1944. They had been involved in three prior assaults of enemy positions in the Pacific-at Leyte and Lingayen in the Philippines and at Iwo Jima. They had seen kamikazes purposely crash into other destroyers and cruisers in their unit and had seen firsthand the bloody results of those crazed tactics. But nothing could have prepared the crew for this moment-an eighty-minute ordeal in which the single small ship was targeted by no fewer than twenty-two Japanese suicide aircraft.<br><br>By the time the unprecedented attack on the <i>Laffey</i> was finished, thirty-two sailors lay dead, more than seventy were wounded, and the ship was grievously damaged. Although she lay shrouded in smoke and fire for hours, the <i>Laffey</i> somehow survived, and the gutted American warship limped from Okinawa's shore for home, where the ship and crew would be feted as heroes.<br><br>Using scores of personal interviews with survivors, the memoirs of crew members, and the sailors' wartime correspondence, historian and author John Wukovits breathes life into the story of this nearly forgotten historic event.

Here are three killer tactics to catch big bulls in deep water.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>MATCH A MAYFLY HATCH </b><br> With the exception of the spawn, mayfly hatches mean the best opportunities to catch big bluegills. Cruise the lake and check any place where wind corrals the bugs into confined areas near deep water<br> (A). &#x201c;Target the banks that are closest to the channel, where the wind blows the larvae into the bank,&#x201d; says Ron Lappin, a retired Kentucky guide and panfish pro. &#x201c;The higher the bank, the better the hatch is. Look for places where the wind can blow across a large area.&#x201d; Cast to the bank and use a slow retrieve, occasionally pausing to let a spinner or jig glide on a semi-slack line just above bottom.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>PITCH AROUND PILINGS </b><br> Bridge pilings across deep areas and large tributaries offer vertical current breaks where bluegills can rise from cooler water to feed near the surface (B). In these spots, Lappin fishes a drop-shot rig: He suspends a Brim Reaper bug on a No. 6 long-shank cricket hook 12 to 18 inches above a 1/16 - to 1/8 &#x2013;ounce cylinder weight. Lappin fishes it on a 9-foot float-and-fly rod and suggests keeping the line length no longer than the rod. &#x201c;A lot of pilings have steel cross members between them,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you&#x2019;ll get the biggest concentrations of bluegills.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><b>CAST IN CURRENTS </b><br> Most reservoirs have manmade current sources, such as a dam, its turbines, culverts, and locks (C). These attract bluegills and are best if they are in deeper spots or have a large concrete structure like a dock piling nearby. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see bluegills almost swarming in these areas after the spawn,&#x201d; says Lappin. He floats a live cricket, rigged on a No. 6 cricket hook, under an acorn-size bobber (Pinch two split shot onto the line between the cricket and bobber), starting on the sunny side of the structure, then shifts to the shaded side, casting directly against the dam.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>In Search of Duende (New Directions Bibelot) (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p><strong>The notion of "duende" became a cornerstone of Federico Garcia Lorca's poetics over the course of his career.</strong></p> In his lecture "Play and the Theory of Duende," he says, ". . .there are no maps nor disciplines to help us find the duende. We only know that he burns the blood like a poultice of broken glass, that he exhausts, that he rejects all the sweet geometry we have learned. . . ." The duende is portrayed by Lorca as a demonic earth spirit containing irrationality, earthiness, and a heightened awareness of death. <em>In Search of Duende</em> gathers Lorca's writings about the duende and about three art forms most susceptible to it: dance, music, and the bullfight. A full bilingual sampling of Lorca's poetry is also included, with special attention to poems arising from traditional Spanish verse forms.

Just twelve, she&#x2019;s tall, skinny, and weak. It&#x2019;s four o&#x2019;clock, and she hasn&#x2019;t been allowed to eat anything all day. Her mother, on the other hand, seems curiously excited. She's about to suggest open-heart surgery on her child to "get to the bottom of this." She checks her teeth for lipstick and, as the doctor enters, shoots the girl a warning glance. This child will not ruin her plans.<br><br><b>Sickened</b><br><br>From early childhood, Julie Gregory was continually X-rayed, medicated, and operated on&#x2014;in the vain pursuit of an illness that was created in her mother&#x2019;s mind. Munchausen by proxy (MBP) is the world&#x2019;s most hidden and dangerous form of child abuse, in which the caretaker&#x2014;almost always the mother&#x2014;invents or induces symptoms in her child because she craves the attention of medical professionals. Many MBP children die, but Julie Gregory not only survived, she escaped the powerful orbit of her mother's madness and rebuilt her identity as a vibrant, healthy young woman.<br><br><b>Sickened </b>is a remarkable memoir that speaks in an original and distinctive Midwestern voice, rising to indelible scenes in prose of scathing beauty and fierce humor. Punctuated with Julie's actual medical records, it re-creates the bizarre cocoon of her family's isolated double-wide trailer, their wild shopping sprees and gun-waving confrontations, the astonishing na�vet� of medical professionals and social workers. It also exposes the twisted bonds of terror and love that roped Julie's family together&#x2014;including the love that made a child willing to sacrifice herself to win her mother's happiness. <br><br>The realization that the sickness lay in her mother, not in herself, would not come to Julie until adulthood. But when it did, it would strike like lightning. Through her painful metamorphosis, she discovered the courage to save her own life&#x2014;and, ultimately, the life of the girl her mother had found to replace her. <b>Sickened</b> takes us to new places in the human heart and spirit. It is an unforgettable story, unforgettably told.</p><p>&#x201c;A painful but wonderfully written memoir that should create greater awareness of a bizarre disorder...

The Aldhouse-Greens entertaining and informative book represents a search, a voyage of discovery in which evidence is sought that there were individuals living in Europe from the Stone Age to the early post-Roman period who believed they were able to liaise with the spirit-world through the medium of trance and who perceived themselves to be part-human and part-animal.The authors support their argument with diverse and rich evidence, including the 30,000-year-old lion-human ivory figurines found in south-western Germany, which may represent monsters seen by shamans in altered states of consciousness; the newly discovered and spectacular Nebra sky-disc, which depicts the sun, moon and the Pleiades, indicating that Bronze Age shamans were using highly sophisticated objects to explore the heavens; and, the Doctors Grave from southeast England, which suggests that a Late Iron Age chieftain, who may have been a shaman, was sent to the Otherworld equipped with hallucinogens, medical kit and divining tools.</p><p>Miranda Aldhouse-Green is Professor of Archaeology and Head of Research in the School of Humanities at the University of Wales, Newport.</p><h2>The Timber Press Guide to Gardening in the Pacific Northwest</h2><p><p>Tired of being lumped into the unwieldy category of a western garden?

Kate Chase studied the scene through the window of her father&#x2019;s carriage, forgetting, for the moment, her misgivings that she was attending the event as a guest rather than playing hostess. The crush of people forced their horses to slow to a walk long before they reached the bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson in the center of the driveway, and the tall white columns of the front portico suddenly seemed to be an interminable distance away.</p><p>&#x201c;Father,&#x201d; Kate said, touching his hand where it rested on the black leather seat between them. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you say that the President and his wife had invited only Cabinet members, a few dignitaries, and their wives to tonight&#x2019;s dinner?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wives, or daughters, as the case may be.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or daughters,&#x201d; amended Kate, smiling. &#x201c;I ask because if the size of this crowd is any indication, it would seem that either you were misinformed, or the vast population of Washington City was.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I trust I didn&#x2019;t misunderstand the president&#x2019;s invitation,&#x201d; her father replied. &#x201c;No, my dear Katie, what you see before you is the capital&#x2019;s most persistent plague&#x2014;patronage seekers. They know they won&#x2019;t be allowed past the doorman tonight, but that won&#x2019;t stop them from clutching at the sleeves and pleading in the ears of any unfortunate official whom they can accost on the way to the door.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. &#x201c;Then we shall have to be quick and clever to avoid them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, and we&#x2019;ll keep the distance from carriage to threshold as short as possible.&#x201d; Salmon P. Chase frowned out the window. Impeded by the throng, the carriage had slowed to a crawl until it finally halted several yards away from the portico. &#x201c;Although that might prove difficult.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mr. Secretary,&#x201d; the driver called down. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get any closer until those other drivers clear away.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate had no desire to spend any more of that lovely spring evening gazing longingly at the brightly lit White House through a carriage window and imagining all she was missing within. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s brave the gauntlet,&#x201d; she proposed. &#x201c;The president and his wife are expecting us.&#x201d;</p><p>Her father nodded, more impatient than she to join the gathering inside. He deplored tardiness and did not tolerate it in himself or anyone else. &#x201c;This will do, George,&#x201d; he called to the driver. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll walk from here.&#x201d;</p><p>Her father helped her down from the carriage, and as she took his arm, she felt a glow of warmth and happiness fill her heart despite the small, sad ache of disappointment that had nagged her ever since the Republican party had selected Mr. Lincoln rather than her father as its candidate. If not for the perfidy of the delegates from his own state of Ohio, her father surely would have been sworn in as president earlier that month rather than Secretary of the Treasury, and Kate, as the widower&#x2019;s eldest daughter, would have become First Lady.</p><p>Salmon P. Chase was, Kate knew to the very core of her being, the better man&#x2014;better educated than Mr. Lincoln, more experienced, more committed to the noble cause of abolition, and vastly more qualified. Father had been a senator and governor, while Mr. Lincoln&#x2014;well, Kate liked him, but if she set sentiment aside and forced herself to be strictly objective, she had no choice but to admit that a kindly country lawyer from the West with but one term in Congress to his credit was ill prepared to steer the ship of state, especially through the rough waters the nation faced. Any observer could see that, and in fact, many had, and had said so in the streets and in the press. No one expected much of the new president, and they expected even less of his overeager, overanxious wife, a matron in her mid-forties who had thus far failed to make a favorable impression on Washington&#x2019;s social elite.</p><p>Fortunately, Mr. Lincoln would have Salmon P. Chase to advise him. As for Mrs. Lincoln, for the good of the nation and the Republican party, some kind lady ought to befriend her, become her confidante, and help her navigate the thorny maze of Washington society.</p><p>Kate resigned herself to the likelihood that no one was better suited for the role than herself, though she was more than twenty years younger than Mrs. Lincoln.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Secretary,&#x201d; a voice rang out. Glancing to her left, Kate glimpsed a freckled young man in a brown suit two sizes too large for his bony frame, waving a handful of papers and grinning hopefully. &#x201c;Mr. Secretary, a moment of your time, if you please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s no one,&#x201d; Kate murmured, not unkindly. Her father was terribly nearsighted, but he hated to wear his spectacles in public and often relied upon Kate to identify people at a distance. He had been known to pass good friends and acquaintances on the sidewalks or halls of Congress without recognizing them, an unfortunate habit that contributed to his reputation as being aloof and uncongenial.</p><p>As other eager, avaricious faces turned their way, Father offered Kate his arm. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s make haste.&#x201d;</p><p>Quickly Kate slipped her hand into the crook of his elbow and hurried off beside him. &#x201c;Perhaps you should throw a few minor treasury appointments after us to distract them,&#x201d; she teased, breathless. &#x201c;Rather like Aphrodite&#x2019;s golden apples, but in reverse.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have no Hippomenes catch my Atalanta,&#x201d; her father declared, quickening his pace as he guided her through the crowd. Laughing, Kate did her best to keep up with him, though she was shorter than her father by nearly half a foot and encumbered by her corset and hoopskirt.</p><p>At last they reached the portico, where the burly, white-haired doorman greeted them in an Irish brogue and admitted them into the vestibule. They passed through the main hall into the Blue Room, a graceful ellipse with tall windows overlooking the south lawn and the Potomac River. It seemed to Kate to be in better repair than the other public rooms of the executive mansion, which were shabbily furnished with threadbare and tobacco-stained rugs, broken furniture, torn wallpaper, and ruined draperies, from which souvenir collectors had snipped pieces until they hung in tatters. Here, however, all was in elegant order. The chairs and settees were upholstered in rich blue and silver damask, the woodwork brilliantly gilded. Ornate mirrors on the marble mantel reflected the light from the chandeliers hanging high above from a frescoed ceiling of cerulean blue, beneath which men of influence clad in evening black and their ladies in elegant gowns of every hue mingled and chatted, the soft blue-and-white carpet muffling their footsteps.</p><p>Before passing from the brightly lit hall into the Blue Room, the Chases paused in the doorway, long enough for almost thirty pairs of eyes to turn their way. Conversations paused as the guests took in the newcomers, and as Kate smiled warmly and nodded gracefully to one acquaintance after another, she drew herself up proudly, knowing how she and her father looked to them. Salmon P. Chase&#x2014;tall, broad- shouldered, and powerfully built, his features strong and regular beneath a high, clear brow projecting intelligence, courage, and dignity&#x2014;was the very image of a statesman. And Kate herself&#x2014;auburn haired, her green eyes flecked with hazel, young, slender, vivacious, becomingly attired in a gown of pale yellow silk, her hair arranged in a simple, elegant twist and adorned with white flowers&#x2014;was the very ideal of the accomplished, dutiful daughter. &#x201c;You look like the king and queen of Washington,&#x201d; her younger sister, Nettie, had sighed wistfully upon their departure from home. Father had taken a moment to lecture his youngest child on the superiority of American democracy to European monarchy, which she accepted with a good-natured shrug, with none of the shame and remorse Father&#x2019;s admonishments evoked in Kate.</p><p>As John Nicolay, the president&#x2019;s private secretary, made the customary introductions, Father escorted Kate across the room where</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln waited to receive their guests. The president&#x2019;s gaunt features became warmer, his eyes brighter, when he smiled, as he did when he shook Father&#x2019;s hand and then Kate&#x2019;s. &#x201c;How is little Nettie?&#x201d; Mr. Lincoln asked, his thick, dark brows rising quizzically, an amusing complement to the high, thin quality of his voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Very well, thank you,&#x201d; Father replied formally, bowing to Mrs. Lincoln.</p><p>Seeing her father and the president together, Kate almost laughed aloud, taken anew by the remarkable distinction between them. If Father looked every inch a statesman, Mr. Lincoln resembled a frontier schoolmaster with no wife to remind him to brush his hair and straighten his coat. &#x201c;Nettie is indeed well,&#x201d; she amended her father&#x2019;s reply, &#x201c;but I confess she was disappointed to be left at home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you bring her along?&#x201d; Mr. Lincoln asked, genuinely perplexed.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Mr. Lincoln,&#x201d; his wife chided him, laughing shortly. Her eyes were sharply blue, her complexion white and smooth, her neck and arms elegantly molded, but she was otherwise plain and tended toward stoutness, which her short stature and her husband&#x2019;s great height unfortunately exaggerated. &#x201c;Children, at a state dinner for the Cabinet? Not even Tad and Willie will be in attendance tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Lincoln smiled benignly down upon his wife. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fortunate to have you here to remind me of such things.&#x201d; He turned back to the Chases with a self-deprecating shrug. &#x201c;When I consider the reams of paper piled upon my desk, which are almost certainly accumulating greater heights even as we speak, I can only hope that an instructive book on presidential manners lies at the bottom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At the very bottom, do you mean?&#x201d; teased Kate, detecting an ironic note in his tone. &#x201c;So deeply buried that no one can expect you to unearth and to read it?&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Lincoln&#x2019;s laugh rang out, rich and full. &#x201c;Why, yes, Miss Chase. You understand me perfectly.&#x201d;</p><p>Father beamed proudly, but as she took Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s hand, Kate detected a flicker of annoyance in the First Lady&#x2019;s eyes above her gracious smile, and she was not sorry to move on. There were wives and daughters to befriend, gentlemen to charm, and people of influence to impress, but as she and her father made their way around the room, Kate often thought she still felt Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s blue eyes upon her, taking her measure with scrupulous, unforgiving precision.</p><p>Kate soon forgot Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s displeasure, swept up in the pleasure of making new acquaintances and engaging in lively conversation that occasionally, and rather delightfully, leaned toward debate. United States Attorney General Edward Bates, black-haired and white bearded, spoke longingly and endearingly of the Missouri home he had only recently departed, while General Simon Cameron, with his keen, deep-set eyes and thin mouth, struck her as insistent and shrewd. One by one Kate addressed them all, and the ladies who had accompanied them, complimenting their attire and inquiring about their children. Kate especially liked the wife of the Secretary of State, Frances Seward, whose dark, intelligent eyes belied the frailty of her form. Unfortunately, Mrs. Seward spent little time in Washington City, preferring her gracious family home and more temperate climate of Auburn, New York&#x2014;but her frequent absence, and that of the vice- president&#x2019;s wife, did leave Kate the second highest-ranking woman of the Executive Branch according to protocol and tradition, behind Mrs. Lincoln, who never let her forget it.</p><p>A moment came when Kate found herself unaccompanied, but just as it occurred to her that they should have been called in to dinner by then, Mrs. Lincoln appeared at her side. &#x201c;Dinner will be delayed somewhat longer,&#x201d; the First Lady explained, drawing her apart from the others. &#x201c;General Scott has not yet arrived.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, of course we must wait for him,&#x201d; Kate replied. &#x201c;I hope he wasn&#x2019;t swallowed up in the crush outside.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he wasn&#x2019;t. A crowd of patronage-seekers is no match for a gentleman who commands entire armies.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be careful what you say in this city, even in jest,&#x201d; Mrs. Lincoln cautioned, linking her arm through Kate&#x2019;s and strolling away from the other guests so that Kate was compelled to come along. &#x201c;Rumors fly so swiftly in Washington that if I were to cross this room right now, I would not be surprised if the people on the other side greeted me with the dreadful news that General Scott met his demise at the hands of a mob on our front doorstep.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate laughed easily. &#x201c;Thank you for the warning. I&#x2019;ll take heed, I assure you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Speaking of rumors.&#x201d; Mrs. Lincoln halted, slipped her arm free from Kate&#x2019;s, and fixed her with an inscrutable look. &#x201c;You do know the rumors circulating about us, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why, no,&#x201d; said Kate. &#x201c;Why should there be any rumors about you and me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because people enjoy gossip even more than they relish believing that accomplished women cannot get along.&#x201d; Mrs. Lincoln smiled, but she glanced past Kate&#x2019;s shoulder as if wary that they would be overheard. &#x201c;They say that you and I are embroiled in a terrible feud.&#x201d;</p><p>Kate was so astonished she laughed. &#x201c;And what reason do they give for it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My overwhelming jealousy at the attentions my husband showed you at the military ball given in his honor when we stopped in Columbus in February on our way to Washington.&#x201d; Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s smile tightened as she nodded to a cabinet official passing nearby. &#x201c;They say he danced with you more often than was seemly and showered you in compliments, while I looked on, weeping by some accounts and seething according to others.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s nonsense,&#x201d; Kate exclaimed, quickly lowering her voice. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t even in Columbus when your train passed through.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why, no, you weren&#x2019;t, were you?&#x201d; mused Mrs. Lincoln as if she had only just remembered&#x2014;although an edge to her voice immediately told Kate that the perceived slight had been in the forefront of her thoughts all evening. &#x201c;You knew the president-elect and his wife and sons would be passing through your own city, and yet some urgent business of far greater importance compelled you away.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not of greater importance, but essential nonetheless.&#x201d; Kate drew herself up to her full height and regarded the first lady steadily. &#x201c;Governor Dennison had appointed my father a state delegate to the Peace Convention. My family had already come to Washington City by the time you reached Columbus, or I would have been there to meet you. I trust Governor Dennison&#x2019;s wife welcomed you as well as I would have done.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Lincoln&#x2019;s smiled deepened and hardened. &#x201c;Or better, perhaps. Almost certainly better.&#x201d;</p><p>With that, she moved off in a swirl of silk skirts, leaving Kate watching after her, utterly astonished.</p><p>Soon thereafter, word came that General Scott was ill and would not be able to join them after all. Mr. Nicolay signaled for the Marine</p><p>Band to strike up a spirited march, and as the brisk, merry tune played, Kate quickly composed herself, found ...</p></p><h2>Aftershocks (Contemporary Romance)</h2><p><b>Timing is everything. . .</b> <p>Model Georgina Hathaway is more than just a beautiful face in a magazine.

Tens of millions of people over several states are affected. For those without access to a generator, there is no running water, no sewage, no refrigeration or light. Food and medical supplies are dwindling. Devices we rely on have gone dark. Banks no longer function, looting is widespread, and law and order are being tested as never before.&nbsp; <br><br>It isn&#x2019;t just a scenario. A well-designed attack on just one of the nation&#x2019;s three electric power grids could cripple much of our infrastructure&#x2014;and in the age of cyberwarfare, a laptop has become the only necessary weapon. Several nations hostile to the United States could launch such an assault at any time. In fact, as a former chief scientist of the NSA reveals, China and Russia have already penetrated the grid.

In <em>Lights Out</em>, Ted Koppel flashes his journalism chops to introduce us to a frightening scenario, where hackers have tapped into and destroyed the United States power grids, leaving Americans crippled. Koppel outlines the many ways our government and response teams are far from prepared for an un-natural disaster that won't just last days or weeks - but months - and also shows us how a growing number of individuals have taken it upon themselves to prepare. Whether you pick up this book to escape into a good story, or for a potentially potent look into the future, you will not be disappointed. <em> &#x2013; Penny Mann</em></p>TED KOPPEL, a 42-year veteran of ABC News, was anchor and managing editor of Nightline from 1980 to 2005.

Jess went quiet. He hadn&#x2019;t meant to fidget, but the pouch strapped to his bare chest felt hot and dangerous, like some animal that might turn on him and bite.</p><p>He looked up at his father as the man snugged the harness bindings closer. When it was suffocatingly tight, he tossed Jess a filthy old shirt.</p><p>He&#x2019;d done this often enough that, while it was still frightening, it was no longer strange&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But there was a sense that this time, this run, was different. Why, Jess didn&#x2019;t know, except that his father seemed more tense than usual.</p><p>So he asked, hesitantly, &#x201c;Da&#x2014;anything I should know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t matter a damn what you know. Lose that book to the Garda and you&#x2019;ll hang, if you&#x2019;re lucky. If I don&#x2019;t get you first. You know the route. Run it flat and fair, and you&#x2019;d best damn well die before you give it to any but the one that&#x2019;s paid for it.&#x201d;</p><p>Callum Brightwell cast a critical eye over his son&#x2019;s thin form, then yanked a vest from a chest and shoved it over Jess&#x2019;s shirt. There was only one button on it. Jess fastened it. It hung two sizes loose, which was the point: better concealment for the harness.</p><p>Brightwell nodded and stepped back. He was a smallish man, runted by poor nutrition in his youth, but now he was dressed well in a bright yellow silk waistcoat and trousers of fine cotton. &#x201c;You look the part,&#x201d; he told Jess. &#x201c;Remember to stay with the cutters. Don&#x2019;t split off on your own unless the Garda spring a trap. Even then, keep to the route.&#x201d;</p><p>Jess ducked his head in acknowledgment. He knew the route. He knew <i>all</i> the routes, all the runs that his family held against competitors throughout the vast city of London. He&#x2019;d trained since he was old enough to walk, clasping the hand of his father and then later toddling behind his older brother, Liam.</p><p>Liam was dead now. He&#x2019;d been seventeen when he was taken in by the London Garda for running books. His family hadn&#x2019;t stepped up to identify him. He&#x2019;d kept the family&#x2019;s code. He&#x2019;d kept his silence to the end.</p><p>And as a reward for that loyalty, the city of London had tossed him in an unmarked pit, along with other unclaimed criminals. Liam had been seventeen, and Jess was now ten, and he had no idea how he was supposed to live up to that legend.</p><p>&#x201c;Da&#x2014;&#x201d; He was risking another slap, or worse, but he took a deep breath and said, &#x201c;Today&#x2019;s a bad day to be running&#x2014;you said that yourself. The Garda are out in force. Why can&#x2019;t this wait?&#x201d;</p><p>Callum Brightwell looked above his son&#x2019;s head, at the sturdy wall of the warehouse. This was one of many bolt-holes he kept for rarities and, of course, the rarest treasures of all, <i>books</i>. Real, original books, shelves and crates full. He was a wealthy, clever man, but in that moment, with the light coming harsh on him through a high, mullioned window, he looked twice his age.</p><p>&#x201c;Just get on with it. I&#x2019;ll expect you back in two hours. Don&#x2019;t be late or I&#x2019;ll get the cane.&#x201d; His father suddenly scowled. &#x201c;If you see your feckless brother, tell him I&#x2019;m waiting, and there&#x2019;ll be hell to pay. He&#x2019;s on the cutters today.&#x201d;</p><p>Even though Jess and Brendan had been born as identical twins, they couldn&#x2019;t have been more different inside. Jess was bold; Brendan tended to be shy. Jess was self-contained; Brendan was prone to explosions of violence.</p><p>Jess was a runner. Brendan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was a schemer.</p><p>Jess knew exactly where Brendan was; he could see him, hiding up on the thin second-floor catwalk, clinging to an old ladder that ran toward the roof. Brendan had been watching, as was his habit. He liked to be up high, away from where Da could lay hands on him, and he liked to avoid risking his hide as a runner when he could.</p><p>&#x201c;If I see him, I&#x2019;ll tell him,&#x201d; he said, and stared hard right at his brother. <i>Get down here, you little shite. </i>Brendan responded by silently swarming up the ladder into the darkness. He&#x2019;d already worked out that Jess was the one running the prize today. Knowing Brendan, he&#x2019;d decided that his skin was worth more than just acting as his brother&#x2019;s decoy.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; his father said sharply. &#x201c;What are you waiting for, a kiss from your mam? Get on with you!&#x201d;</p><p>He pushed Jess toward the massive reinforced warehouse door, which was opened by three silent men; Jess didn&#x2019;t know them, tried not to learn their names because they died quick in that line of work. He paused and took deep, quick breaths. Getting ready. He spotted the mob of cutters ranged about in the alley and on the street beyond; kids, his age or younger, all ready to run their routes.</p><p>They were waiting only for him.</p><p>He let out a wild war cry and set off at a sprint. The other cutters took it up as a cheer, thin arms and legs pumping, darting between the startled pedestrians in their workaday clothes. Several lunged out into the street, which was a hazardous adventure; they darted between steam carriages and ignored the angry shouts of the drivers. The cutters re-formed into a mob of twelve or so kids at the next corner, and Jess stuck with them for the first part of the route. It was safer in numbers, as the streets got cleaner and the passersby better dressed. Four long blocks of homes and businesses, then a right turn at a tavern already doing good business even so early in the morning; smooth running, until a hard-looking man darted out from a greengrocer and yanked a girl out of his crew by her long hair. She&#x2019;d made herself too easy to grab; most of the girls knotted up their hair on top of their heads or shaved it short.</p><p>Jess had to fight his urge to slow down and help her.</p><p>The girl screamed and fought, but the big man wrestled her to the curb and backhanded her into a heap. &#x201c;Damn cutters!&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Garda! <i>Garda!</i> Runners on the loose!&#x201d;</p><p>That tore it. <i>Always some busybody do-gooder trying to save the day,</i> was what Jess&#x2019;s father always said; that&#x2019;s why he sent the cutters in packs, most with worthless decoy trash in their harnesses. The Garda rarely scored, but when they did, they paid any informants off rich who put them on the trail of the smugglers.</p><p>Citizens turned, eyes avid with the idea of free cash, and Jess tucked his chin down and ran.</p><p>The cutters wheeled and broke up and re-formed like a flock of birds. Some carried knives and used them when grabbed; it was chancy to do that, very chancy, because if a kid was caught with a bloody knife it&#x2019;d be the rope for sure, whether it was a flesh wound on the man he&#x2019;d cut or a mortal blow. The boy to Jess&#x2019;s left&#x2014;too big to be running, though he was probably younger than Jess&#x2019;s age&#x2014;veered straight into a wall of oncoming drunks. He had a knife and slashed with it; Jess saw a bright ribbon of blood arcing in the air and then didn&#x2019;t look back.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t. He had to concentrate on escape.</p><p>His route split at the next corner; they&#x2019;d all break up now, running separately to draw the Garda&#x2019;s numbers thin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or at least, that was the plan.</p><p>What happened was that when Jess reached the corner, there were Garda bunched up <i>on his route</i>. They spotted him and let out a fierce, angry yell.</p><p>He made an instant decision he knew his da would beat him black for making: he left the route.</p><p>He almost banged into two other cutters as he veered right; they gave him identically startled looks, and one yelled at him to get off their patch. He ignored her, and despite the ache growing in his chest, the smothering drag of the book, he put on a new burst of speed and outpaced them both.</p><p>He heard a cry behind him and glanced back to see that the Garda were pouring out from alleyways. Bloody lobsters in their grimy red coats. They swiftly caught the others.</p><p>Not Jess, though. Not yet.</p><p>He dodged down a dark, twisting passage too narrow to even be named an alley; even as small as he was, his shoulders brushed brick on both sides. A rusted nail caught at his shirt and ripped the sleeve, and for a heart-stopping second he thought the leather of his harness might catch, but he kept moving. Couldn&#x2019;t go fast now, because of the inky darkness in the shadows, but his nose told him it was a popular dumping ground for rotting fish. The bricks felt slimy and cold under his fingers.</p><p>He could still hear the Garda hue and cry behind him, but they couldn&#x2019;t fit their thick bodies through this warren, and for a moment, as he spotted a thin slice of light at the end, he wasn&#x2019;t so sure he could fit either. It narrowed and narrowed, until he had to turn sideways and edge along with the rough brick tearing at his clothes. The book wedged him in as tight as a cork in a bottle, and he fought the urge to panic.</p><p><i>Think. You can get out of this.</i></p><p>He let out his breath and flattened his chest as much as he could, and it gained him the extra half inch he needed to edge free of the crush.</p><p>He stumbled out between two fancy buildings onto a wide, clean street he knew he should recognize, and yet it seemed odd, out of place&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. until it snapped into focus.</p><p>He&#x2019;d come out only three blocks from his family&#x2019;s town house, where his mother and father took such pains looking gentrified. If he was seized here, there&#x2019;d be some who&#x2019;d know him on sight, and that would mean much, much worse for not just him; his whole family would be brought down. He had to get out of here. <i>Now.</i></p><p>He rushed out into the street, directly under the wheels of a steam carriage, and into the darkness of another alley. It led in the right direction but twisted wrong soon enough. He&#x2019;d not explored all the alleys near his home; he had enough to do with the routes the runners used. That was why his father had always ordered him to keep to the route&#x2014;because it was so easy to be lost in complicated London, and getting lost while carrying contraband could be deadly.</p><p>At the next street he spotted a landmark a few blocks away: the glittering dome of St. Paul&#x2019;s Serapeum, the physical presence of the Great Library in London, and one of the largest daughter libraries in Europe. It was beautiful and deadly, and he averted his eyes and made a vow to never, <i>never </i>go that way.</p><p>But he didn&#x2019;t have a choice.</p><p>A Garda emerged from a doorway, clapped eyes on him, and shouted. Behind his pointing finger, the Garda was young, maybe the age Liam had been when he&#x2019;d taken the rope. This young man was blond and had a weak chin, and his secondhand uniform fit about as well as Jess&#x2019;s disguise.</p><p>But he was fast. Too fast. As Jess took off running he heard the slap of the Garda&#x2019;s feet behind him, and the shrill, urgent toot of his whistle. They&#x2019;d be coming from all around him. If they boxed him in here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>He took the only clear path out of danger. It was another dark, cramped alley, but the Garda was no side of beef and slipped through almost as easily as Jess did. Jess had to keep running, though his weary lungs were pumping fire, and the long legs of the Garda gained on him when they reached open street again. The watery London sunshine seemed to beat down on Jess&#x2019;s head, and he was dripping with sweat. He was terrified that he might damage the book with it.</p><p>Not as terrified as he was of being caught, though.</p><p>More whistles. The Garda closed in.</p><p>Jess had no choice at all. They were driving him in one direction&#x2014;toward the Serapeum. If he could get past the Garda barricades there, it was Library territory and under entirely different laws. The London Garda couldn&#x2019;t trespass without clearances.</p><p>Up ahead, he saw the orange-and-black wood of the Garda barricade across the street, and the line of supplicants waiting to have their credentials checked. Jess pulled for his last reserves of speed, because that damned rabbit-heeled Garda was close enough to brush fingers on his shirt. He lurched forward, aimed for a hole in the crowd, and threw himself bodily forward toward the barricade. As the Garda behind him yelled for help, Jess grabbed the painted tiger-striped wood and vaulted over it in one smooth motion, hit the ground running on the other side, and heard the shouts of surprise and dismay echoing behind him. Someone laughed and yelled at him to keep going, and he grinned fiercely and risked a look back.</p><p>The Garda had stopped at the barricade&#x2014;or, at least, one of his fellows had stopped him by getting in his way and holding him back. The two were scuffling, the younger man shouting angrily. His blood was still up from the chase, or he&#x2019;d have had more sense. Jess knew he didn&#x2019;t have long; they&#x2019;d be sending a message to the High Garda, the elite guards of the Library, to intercept him. He needed to get through, and fast.</p><p>The street ahead had but fifty people on foot, including at least ten Scholars stalking in their billowing black robes. No steam carriages; they weren&#x2019;t permitted here anymore, not since the Library had closed this road to through traffic. The golden dome rose serene and gleaming overhead, and below it, a waterfall of steps flowed down from it.</p></p><h2>Solitude: A Return to the Self</h2><p>A provocative and highly articulate meditation on solitude, Anthony Storr explores the connection between solitude and the creative personality. From the great to the obscure, Storr examines the uses that all kinds of people make of solitude in times of bereavement and depression, in escaping from the pressures of daily life, in communing with a higher power through prayer, and in finding and expressing their deepest selves.</p><p><b>Anthony Storr</b> was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, a Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and an Emeritus Fellow of Green College, Oxford. He was the author of numerous books, including <i>The Integrity of the Personality, The Dynamics of Creation, The Essential Jung,</i> and <i>The Art of Psychotherapy.</i> Dr. Storr died in 2001.British psychotherapist Storr takes issue with the predominate view in the West that intimate relationships are the exclusive source and measure of mental health and personal satisfaction. In this far-reaching work, he considers the impact of voluntary as well as enforced solitude, particularly on creative persons such as composers, writers, and philosophers. Their efforts take place chiefly in solitude, and Storr argues that solitude has restorative value for the ordinary individual as well. His intriguing analyses of figures such as Kafka, Kipling, Beatrix Potter, Beethoven, Newton, and Wittgenstein offer compelling evidence that individuals may achieve happiness and stability through their work, even when their interpersonal relationships are inferior. A book of substance; highly recommended.

Despite a lack of movement, the bright watercolor illustrations are irrepressibly cheery. Unlike the previous books, which centered on specific holidays, this plot centers on the birthday of the hapless Mr. Whiskers and his culinary attempts prior to a visit from his picky sister Sarah. After he has had several kitchen disasters, Grandmother, Maggie, and the neighbors save Mr. Whiskers' pride and birthday feast. A subplot of a stray puppy that Mr. Whiskers saves and returns is wrapped up when young Maggie gives him a puppy from the same litter as a birthday gift. Characterization is minimal, dialogue is sometimes uninspired, but the story moves along too quickly for these to become major flaws here. The book is a bit lengthy for the littlest listeners, but fans of Cranberryport will be glad to see their friends again. Joanna G.

He found a centuries-old, family-run tannery to prepare the ox hides in the medieval way; he undertook an exhaustive search for skilled harness makers (the only people who would know how to stitch the three-quarter-inch-thick hides together); he located one of the last pieces of Irish-grown timber tall enough to make the mainmast. But his courage and resourcefulness were truly tested on the open seas, including one heart-pounding episode when he and his crew repaired a dangerous tear in the leather hull by hanging over the side--their heads sometimes submerged under the freezing waves--to restitch the leather. A modern classic in the tradition of Kon-Tiki, "The Brendan Voyage seamlessly blends high adventure and historical relevance.

This hefty book contains a fifth of Kael's total output. It reprints all of her most famous reviews, including her controversial treatments of <i>Last Tango in Paris</i>, <i>The Long Goodbye</i>, and <i>Nashville</i>. Also here are some of her best longer essays, "Movie Brutalists," "Trash, Art, and the Movies," and &amp;quoy;Cary Grant: the Man from Dream City." <i>Raising Kane,</i> Kael's book-length revisionist view of <i>Citizen Kane</i>, is reproduced in its entirety. Kael's style is impassioned, incisive, witty, and deeply personal. In the preface to this extraordinary volume, Kael says, "I'm frequently asked why I don't write my memoirs. I think I have."In this mammoth anthology, former New Yorker film critic Kael skims the cream from 10 of her previous review compilations published between 1965 and 1991, adding a generous excerpt from The Citizen Kane Book (1971). In more than 275 pointed, wisecracking, sometimes maddening, always engaging reviews, Kael deflates pretensions, skewers schlock and zeroes in on what makes good movies work. She files opinionated, often politically incorrect put-downs of Dances with Wolves, Platoon, Rain Man, Fellini Satyricon, West Side Story, The Color Purple and Lenny, while revealing her eclectic, unpredictable taste in plaudits for Lolita, Prizzi's Honor, Tootsie, Z, The Magic Flute and My Beautiful Laundrette. Kael resolutely approaches film as an art form that must be understood on its own terms, yet her reviews depict precisely how movies interact with life, popular culture and the collective psyche, making this a treasure trove of some of the best film criticism available.

But on day one of sixth grade, Ray stays home sick, and Jay is on his own. No big deal. It's a pretty nice school, good kids, too. But Jay quickly discovers a major mistake: No one seems to know a thing about his brother. Ray's not on the attendance lists, doesn't have a locker, doesn't even have a student folder. Jay almost tells the school -- almost -- but then decides that this lost information could be very...useful. And fun. <br> <br> As Ray and Jay exploit a clerical oversight, they each find new views on friendship, honesty, what it means to be a twin -- and what it means to be yourself.

For two years, Stross gained unprecedented access to the venture capitalists at Benchmark, an upstart firm founded by thirtysomething renegades whose average height happens to be 6�5��. Since Benchmark's founding in 1995, each partner's net worth has increased, on average, $100 million annually. <br><br>Stross was present as the Benchmark boys debated which businesses to support, and by recounting their conversations in testosterone-rich detail, he offers readers the most precise and enlightening account of the ways in which venture capitalists think, evaluate prospects, and wield influence.<br><br>Stross also gained access to a number of the Benchmark-backed start-ups, including a small, privately held San Jose company called eBay. The value of the company grew from $20 million to more than $21 billion within two years of Benchmark's investment, an increase of 100,000 percent. <i>Business Week</i> called it "probably the best venture capital investment of all time."<br><br>Venture capitalists have become iconic symbols of our time, just as investment bankers, investigative journalists, and hippies defined previous eras. In eBoys, Randall Stross has vividly captured the interplay of ambition, personality, experimentation, and risk, all acted out, larger than life, as the men of Benchmark and the entrepreneurs they back play their remarkable roles in the new world of Internet commerce and the creation of vast, sudden wealth.</p><p>If you want to understand the 1990s, you have to understand venture capitalists. These are the people who listen to business pitches by the score, the financial-world equivalent of miners turning over tons of earth in search of precious metal. They're looking for the next Amazon.com, the next Yahoo!, the next eBay. Randall E. Stross, who teaches business history at San Jos� State University, just happened to be there when a firm called Benchmark Capital discovered eBay. <i>eBoys</i> tells the story of how a group of not-quite-middle-aged men came to make an investment that returned a Silicon Valley record of 100,000 percent.<p> Stross is a gifted storyteller who weaves the personal histories of the Benchmark partners with stories of how the firm came to back such companies as Priceline.com and Webvan. We meet guys who weren't born to privilege, men who took unconventional routes into the venture capital business. Probably the most intriguing is Dave Beirne, a hyperaggressive executive recruiter who went into the business after realizing venture capitalists are the ones who really call the shots at high-tech start-ups. We also see the problems Silicon Valley guys have when they try to dot-com the bricks-and-mortar world. The short tale of an aborted partnership between Benchmark and Toys 'R' Us illustrates why the old economy is so mystified by the new.</p><p> Anyone interested in how business works should find something of interest in <i>eBoys</i>. From the organizational structure and corporate culture of Benchmark to the histories and personalities of its partners to its adventures in the world of Internet start-ups, it's a digital snapshot that reveals how successful businesses look, think, and mine gold in today's economy. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>"Writing with all the drama and speed of the Internet itself, Randall Stross spins a tale of risk-takers and rule-breakers that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This eye-opening firsthand account of the young, gutsy, and mega-rich entrepreneurs who are financing today's hottest Web-based businesses will leave you gasping. It's an insider's look at a very cloistered world--the one at the center of the most talked about revolution in business history."--Jo�l Glenn Brenner, author of The Emperors of Chocolate<br><br>"This is the one--the book about Silicon Valley we've all been waiting for. Randall Stross is the first journalist to truly crack the code, to get so far inside this world that what's emerged is not just an authoritative account but one that has the absolute ring of truth. With its vividly drawn characters, unforgettable scenes, and crackling dialogue, eBoys puts you in the room where instant companies--and instant wealth--are created. And when this age finally ends--as it surely will--eBoys will take its place as the definitive account of one of the wildest eras in the history of American capitalism."--Joseph Nocera, editor-at-large, Fortune<br><br>"Randall Stross's eBoys is that rare book that's both an important work and a fun read. The Silicon Valley venture capitalists whom Stross writes about with such verve and grace are the equivalent of the tech world's Hollywood casting directors, holding daily tryouts to spot tomorrow's talent. The miracle of this book is that somehow we're in the room as some of the best known VCs in the Valley audition the future. The result is not only a rich, page-turning tale but a voyeur's dream that for my money is the single best look at the VC world to date."--Gary Rivlin, author of The Plot to Get Bill Gates<br><br>"This book is so realistic that if you have been in a venture capital meeting it will make you sweaty all over again. eBoys is a terrifically written account of venture capitalists in action, financing the investor dreams or nightmares of the future with high-flying e-business companies like Webvan and eBay and more." The book is a great read."--Jack Covert, president and founder, 800-CEO-READ</p><h2>The Magic of Hydrogen Peroxide</h2><p>An Ounce of Hydrogen Peroxide is Worth a Pound of Cure Hydrogen peroxide is trusted by every hospital and emergency room in the country for its remarkable ability to kill deadly germs like E. coli and the swine flu virus.

But a house of her own, where she could truly take root, has eluded her. With this collection&#x2014;spanning three decades, and including never-before-published work&#x2014;Cisneros has come home at last. <br><br>Ranging from the private (her parents&#x2019; loving and tempestuous marriage) to the political (a rallying cry for one woman&#x2019;s liberty in Sarajevo) to the literary (a tribute to Marguerite Duras), and written with her trademark lyricism, these signature pieces recall transformative memories as well as reveal her defining artistic and intellectual influences. Poignant, honest, deeply moving, this is an exuberant celebration of a life in writing lived to the fullest.</p></p><p><b>SANDRA CISNEROS</b>&nbsp;is the author of two widely acclaimed novels, a story collection, two books of poetry, and, most recently, <i>Have You Seen Marie? </i>She is the recipient of numerous awards, including National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships, the Lannan Literary Award, the American Book Award, the Thomas Wolfe Prize, and a MacArthur Fellowship. Her work has been translated into more than twenty languages. Cisneros is the founder of the Alfredo Cisneros del Moral and Macondo Foundations, which serve creative writers. She lives in Mexico.<br><br> www.sandracisneros.com&#x201c;<i>A House of My Own </i>tells the story of the award-winning Mexican-American novelist, poet, short story writer and essayist&#x2019;s quest for her dream house, in a book as beautifully appointed as her legendary &#x2018;purple&#x2019; home in San Antonio, with lustrous pages, color photographs and colorful chapter headings that lend it the look and feel of an objet d&#x2019;art . . . These &#x2018;stories from my life&#x2019; assemble nonfiction drawn from three decades, touching on themes similar to those found in her fiction&#x2014;identity, belonging, culture, feminism, the importance of home and kinship&#x2014;each has a new introduction explaining the context and why she chose it. The book&#x2019;s atypical form offers a truer portrait of Cisneros than might be found in a conventional autobiography. A literary salon steeped in storytelling and writers, it honors her process and influences and draws attention to crucial and difficult points of her development. Like a manifesto, it reasserts Cisneros&#x2019;s artistic credo&#x2014;living alone, charting her path, seeing writing as &#x2018;a resistance, an act against forgetting, a war against oblivion, against not counting, as women&#x2019; . . . Cisneros pays tribute to every friend, artist, musician and tradition that inspired her . . . <i>A House of My Own</i> reminds us of the importance of our place in the world, and of the holiness of what we find there. Cisneros is right there in the room, fiercely candid, warm and gracious, talking about everything: the best recipe for&nbsp;<i>mole</i>, her humiliating fifth-grade report card, the men in her life, her dreams about old houses and forgotten pets&#x2014;and writing, always writing.&#x201d; &#x2014;Gina Webb, <i>The Atlanta Journal Constitution<br></i><br> &#x201c;Cisneros is best known&nbsp;for <i>T<i>he House on Mango Street</i></i>, about Esperanza, a Mexican-American girl who turns to writing for solace from her chaotic Chicago family life. With her newest book Cisneros fans will finally find out whether Esperanza&#x2019;s story was based on the author&#x2019;s real experience. In a tone that is intimate and inviting&#x2014;indeed, we feel we are sitting right next to the author as she sips tea (or chugs tequila) at her home in Mexico, and recounts her adventures with a laugh and a shake of the head: <i>Ay Dios mio</i>.&nbsp;That is not to say Cisneros&#x2019;s memoir is insular, accessible only to women, or writers, or those from immigrant backgrounds. Much of the book is focused on the hardships of writing, [but] it is as much an ode to pursuing one&#x2019;s passion despite all odds as it is a meditation on family, friends, and finding a home. We follow her on her quest for enlightenment, for worldliness, artistic substance, and a career to sustain her. What she finds along the way is much more, including poverty, war, loss, and a depression that nearly kills her. She also happens to come across a gaggle of colorful folk that in some way reinforce her resolve<i>.&nbsp;</i>These are her teachers: writers, brujas, ancestors, and friends&#x2014;people who inspire her faith. The book pays homage to them, the patterns cohesive in the author&#x2019;s intention to assemble a picture of the mansion of the spirit . . . Cisneros has found a place in the world of letters, but longing for a home has kept her spirit restless . . . Wherever she settles, even when she settles, she is Sandra Cisneros, a wandering spirit and creator of stories. &#x2018;Stories without beginning or end, connecting everything little and large, blazing from the center of the universe into&nbsp;<i>el infinito</i>&nbsp;called the great out there.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2014;Sandra Ramirez, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i><br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Rather than writing an autobiography, Cisneros has documented her life through a m�lange of essay, poetry&#x2014;and battle cry.&#x201d; &#x2014;Natalie Beach, <i>oprah.com&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;Tantalizing. In no way is this a traditional memoir with tidy numbered chapters and a smooth arc. Instead, Cisneros collects writing, lectures, newspaper articles, keynote speeches, stories repeated out loud but only now finding their way onto the page&#x2014;and assembles them into one beating heart.&#x201d; &#x2014;Maggie Galehouse, <i>Houston Chronicle</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &#x201c;Sandra Cisneros understands that a place molds you, as much as family and friends. Her new collection stitches together three decades of her unique life into a kind of rolling memoir. Not until near the end do you realize what Cisneros has done, crafting a collection that lays out memories as the mind often sees them&#x2014;in pieces, in fits and starts. Each work is prefaced by an introduction that provides context and glue for the book as a whole. They're as delightful to read as the pieces themselves, and are classic Cisneros. Her prose reads like poetry, rhythmic and energetic; her poetry is as natural and effortless as plainspoken prose. In fact, this is what makes Cisneros who she is as a writer: simple, melodious language that explores emotions and brings big ideas down to earth . . . This memoir has the transcendent sweep of a full life and would make a great movie. It is for anyone looking for inspiration to travel far, live large and write . . . A full and satisfying portrait [of] how the writer got&#x2014;and kept&#x2014;her mojo.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dwight Silverman, <i>Houston Chronicle</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;From her breakout book, <i>The House on Mango Street, </i>to this new collection, Cisneros&#x2019;s concerns about finding a home have been at the forefront of her work . . . Now, after decades of traveling [and] as she&#x2019;s settling into life in Mexico, Cisneros is not only finding a new purpose in her life, but also her longed-for spiritual home. <i>A House of My Own, </i>Cisneros&#x2019;s new collection of biographical essays and reflections, serves as a memoir of her restlessness and her movement toward happiness, [and] reveals an even greater scope to her talent and thoughtfulness . . . This supposed provocateur has found a home&#x2014;and now, so she says, she&#x2019;s finding her voice.&#x201d; &#x2014;Richard Z. Santos, <i>Kirkus<br></i><br> &#x201c;This Chicago-born writer has always been a fierce talent. No one writes like her, and for a long time, no one told the stories she did so masterfully in her poems and novels, the stories of Mexican people, of working class people. Perhaps most importantly, she wrote her life, a life many of us didn&#x2019;t know was an option as &#x2018;nobody&#x2019;s mother and nobody&#x2019;s wife&#x2019; . . .&nbsp;<i>A House of My Own</i>&nbsp;is a compilation of true stories and non-fiction pieces that form a &#x2018;jigsaw autobiography&#x2019; of the author&#x2019;s life. The thread that connects each story is the idea of home and all that means: building your own for the first time, belonging to two countries, and how our childhood homes shape us. Cisneros is kind and warm and honest: everything you hope your literary hero will be.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tina Vasquez, <i>Jezebel <br></i><br> &#x201c;The beloved author gets intimate in her new book&#x2014;a rich compilation of true stories and photos from [her] life and career. In the introduction, Cisneros explains that the book is a way to understand her life over three decades&#x2014;from 1984 to 2014 to be exact. <i>A House of My Own</i>&nbsp;takes readers to many places Cisneros has traveled, from Chiapas, Mexico to Hydra, one of the Saronic Islands of Greece and where she finished writing&nbsp;<i>The House on Mango Street</i>. <i>A House of My Own</i>&nbsp;helped Cisneros realize many advantages of growing older. You get to know yourself better, she said, and won&#x2019;t give your time away to just anyone. &#x2018;Your time is the most valuable thing you have,&#x2019; she says.&#x201d; &#x2014;Amaris Castillo, <i>Vivala</i><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;With a phrasing and bravado echoing Saul Bellow's Augie March, Cisneros writes, &#x2018;I was north-of-the-border born and bred, street tough and city smart, wise to the ways of trick or treat.&#x2019;&nbsp; Her new autobiographical work is very much about borders and about houses, particularly &#x2018;the house one calls the self.&#x2019; It is made up of nonfiction chapters, most of which have previously appeared. Make no mistake, though. <i>A House of My Own</i> isn't a greatest-hits collection. It is a surprisingly resonant account of Cisneros's life, which is woven through each of these pieces, regardless of their subject. These essays provide a multiplicity of perspectives on Cisneros, a place where each of these writings can talk with the others, where a conversation can take place while the reader eavesdrops. A complex, nuanced picture of the writer emerges.&#x201d; &#x2014;Patrick T. Reardon, <i>Chicago Tribune<br></i><br> &#x201c;In <i>A House of My Own</i>, Cisneros takes readers behind the typewriters she has written upon over the decades, revealing the rooms in which her novels and poems were composed, the thoughts circling her mind as she created the characters so many have adored, and introducing the people she loved and lost along the way. . . [She] talks of words as medicine and libraries as medicine cabinets. Through her inclusion of book introductions she wrote for other authors, we get rich glimpses into her relationships with fellow writers, sitting with them at tables as they sip beers and share life. And when we read older articles that tell of thoughts the author no longer thinks, Cisneros grants new insights . . . The writer also explores poverty and wealth, often through the lens of art.&nbsp;Throughout each story, though written for a diverse smattering of purposes and people, is Cisneros&#x2019;s constant molding of words like clay . . . Her words will make existing fans love her more, and drive new readers to reach for her previous works after closing this one.&#x201d; &#x2014;Christina Ledbetter, <i>Associated Press/The Washington Post <br></i><br> &#x201c;Generous, welcoming and deeply gratifying . . . This hefty volume of what is aptly being called a &#x2018;jigsaw autobiography&#x2019; gathers three decades of Cisneros's nonfiction writings that showcase her talent as a lyrical essayist. Long-time fans will recognize her inimitable style that frequently spirals into lush sensory language. But the real gift here is in learning about Cisneros's creative process, her early struggles as a &#x2018;migrant writer,&#x2019; her literary influences and the difficult life-changing moments in her personal journey.&#x201d; &#x2014;Rigoberto Gong�lez, <i>NBC News<br></i><br> &#x201c;The only girl among six brothers, Chicago-born author and poet Cisneros describes finding a sense of belonging in like-minded authors&#x2014;Gwendolyn Brooks, Marguerite Duras&#x2014;and travel, including the Greek cottage where she wrote her first novel, in <i>A House of My Own.</i>&#x201d; &#x2014;Megan O&#x2019;Grady, <i>Vogue<br></i><br> &#x201c;Brilliant, lovely, spirited . . . Cisneros&#x2019;s collection of lectures, essays and family memories explores human yearning for home, a safe place where we can be ourselves. For Cisneros, the daughter of a Mexican-American mother and a Mexican father, it meant straddling traditional and contemporary cultures and setting out to find her place in the world . . . The title essay recounts her early days of living and writing in Bucktown, &#x2018;a down-at-the-heels&#x2019; neighborhood of Chicago, where Nelson Algren once roamed and not far from Saul Bellow territory.

In these letters, Havel wrote of his own reflections on the theatre, on society and on philosophy.</p><p>Vaclav Havel was born in Czechoslovakia in 1936. Among his plays, those best known in the West areThe Garden Party, The Memorandum, Largo Desolato, Temptation, and three one-act plays, Audience,Private View and Protest. He is a founding spokesman of Charter 77 and the author of many influential essays on the nature of totalitarianism and dissent. In 1979 he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for his involvement in the human rights movement. Out of this imprisonment came his book of letters to his wife, Letters to Olga (1981). In November 1989 he helped to found the Civic Forum, the first legal opposition movement in Czechoslovakia in forty years; in December 1989 he was elected President of Czechoslovakia; and in 1994 became the first President of the independent Czech Republic.

Soon, discontent would erupt in what became known as Italy&#x2019;s &#x201c;Hot Autumn.&#x201d;<br><br> A young worker from the impoverished south arrives at Fiat&#x2019;s Mirafiori factory in Turin, where his darker complexion begins to fade from the fourteen-hour workdays in sweltering industrial heat. He is frequently late for work, and sells his blood when money runs low. He fakes a crushed finger to win sick leave. His bosses try to withhold his wages. Our cynical, dry-witted narrator will not bend to their will. &#x201c;I want everything, everything that&#x2019;s owed to me,&#x201d; he tells them. &#x201c;Nothing more and nothing less, because you don&#x2019;t mess with me.&#x201d;<br><br> Around him, students are holding secret meetings and union workers begin halting work on the assembly lines, crippling the Mirafiori factory with months of continuous strikes. Before long, barricades line the roads, tear gas wafts into private homes, and the slogan &#x201c;We Want Everything&#x201d; is ringing through the streets. Wrought in spare and measured prose, Balestrini&#x2019;s novel depicts an explosive uprising.

Balestrini currently lives in Rome, where he helps run the monthly magazine of cultural intervention <i>Alfabeta2</i>.&#x201c;A fine example of a literary use of expressions that were then burgeoning in factories and mass meetings, caught between student unrest and worker fury.&#x201d; <br><b> &#x2014;Umberto Eco, author of <i>The Name of the Rose</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In this fierce, compelling novel, Balestrini has found a way to individualise the universal, and universalise the individual, creating a document of the Italian labour struggles of the 1970s that has great value both as art and history. Balestrini becomes a channel for the working-class narrator, who stands for all the Southern masses who come north to the car factories to participate in the Italian &#x2018;economic miracle.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s a book which charted a new course for fiction, one that deserves further exploration.&#x201d; <br><b> &#x2014;Hari Kunzru, author of <i>Gods Without Men</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;We would do well to study how it was that Balestrini made politics and fiction and art, all in once place ...&nbsp;one of the most compelling pieces of literature of the entire second half of the twentieth century.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;Rachel Kushner, <i>New Yorker</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One of the best novels of 2016 ...

Hershey&#39;s Extraordinary Life of Wealth, Empire, and Utopian Dreams</h2><p>The name Hershey evokes many things: chocolate bars, the company town in Pennsylvania, one of America's most recognizable brands. But who was the man behind the name? In this compelling biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael D'Antonio gives us the real-life rags-to-riches story of Milton S. Hershey, a largely uneducated businessman whose idealistic sense of purpose created an immense financial empire, a town, and a legacy that lasts to this day.<p></p><p>Hershey, the son of a minister's daughter and an irresponsible father who deserted the family, began his career inauspiciously when the two candy shops he opened both went bankrupt. Undeterred, he started the Lancaster Caramel Company, which brought him success at last.

He built the world's largest chocolate factory and a utopian village for his workers on a large tract of land in rural Pennsylvania, and used his own fortune to keep his workers employed during the Great Depression. In addition, he secretly willed his fortune to a boys' school and orphanage, both of which now control a vast endowment.</p><p></p><p>Extensively researched and vividly written, <i>Hershey</i> is the fascinating story of this uniquely American visionary.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p><b>Michael D'Antonio</b> is the author of many acclaimed books, including <i>Atomic Harvest, Fall from Grace, Tin Cup Dreams, Mosquito, </i>and <i>The State Boys Rebellion. </i>His work has also appeared in <i>Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, Los Angeles Times Magazine, Discover, </i>and many other publications.

It's a Moorish-style fortress with ornamental towers and a green tile roof. The view from its veranda is the best one available. To the south a scene that looks like a model railroad display comes to life. Cars speed along smooth asphalt highways. Lush cornfields give way to a color-splashed amusement park with ten roller coasters, a Ferris wheel, and a snaking monorail. Beyond the neon and flapping pennants stand old factory buildings, church spires, and houses. Every once in a while a freight train will snake its way along the tracks that slice through the valley. </p><p> A drive into town on Sand Beach Road, which becomes Park Avenue, takes you along the east flank of the park. The double-track roller coaster -- ninety feet high at its tallest point -- is so close to the road that a falling cap could land on your car. Farther along, on a quieter, shady stretch of road waits a small zoo, which is set beside a pristine little creek. Park Avenue then takes a sharp turn and climbs up and over a bridge that crosses railroad tracks. On the other side you are suddenly deposited in another place and time. </p><p> In downtown Hershey, the streetlights are shaped like giant Kisses candies. A century-old factory made of soft red brick sprouts a pair of giant smokestacks decorated with the letters H-E-R-S-H-E-Y. The emerald fairways of a golf course stretch out from the factory lawn. Across the avenue, gracious old houses, some dating from 1905, occupy carefully manicured properties. </p><p> All of Hershey, including the zoo, the antique town, the amusement park, the playful streetlights, and even the factory, is clean and neat and cheerful. Even the names of the major streets -- Chocolate Avenue and Cocoa Avenue -- bring a smile to a visitor's face. And that's before he stops, gets out of the car, and realizes that the air in this Willy Wonka place smells like sweet cocoa. Hershey always smells like this. On a humid summer day when there is no breeze it's so strong you can taste it. </p><p> In this town of 13,000 souls, business people and civic boosters promote an image of kindhearted contentment. Squabbling is bad for business, and the main businesses in little Hershey -- tourism and candy -- rack up sales in excess of $5 billion per year. For this reason, the great howl of protest that erupted in Hershey in the summer of 2002 drew reporters and TV news crews from around the world. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> It all started with small groups of worried citizens meeting in living rooms and kitchens. Then townspeople noticed handmade signs tacked to light poles, staked on lawns, and taped onto shop windows. Some said, "Derail the Sale." Others warned, "Wait 'til Mr. Hershey finds out!" </p><p> The object of these protests was the Milton Hershey School Trust, which held controlling interest in the famous chocolate company for the benefit of a residential school for needy children. The stock was worth as much as $10 billion and the trust was planning to sell it to the highest bidder. Fifty-seven years earlier, when founder Milton S. Hershey died, the trust guaranteed that local residents who shared a common sense of purpose and community would run the company and protect the economy of the town. If the stock was sold, the chocolate-making firm that had represented the playful and prosperous spirit of the community for a century would pass from local control. </p><p> Worried conversations about the sale quickly led to an organized opposition. Finally, on a scorching hot Friday in August, more than five hundred citizens marched through downtown waving placards and shouting while police looked on. </p><p> This being Hershey, when the people took to the streets they were careful to dress nicely and walk with care, avoiding damage to private lawns and public gardens. Younger protesters kept a kind eye on the elderly marchers to make sure they didn't suffer in the heat. Nobody cursed. Nobody threw a punch, a bottle, or a scrap of litter. </p><p> But as mild mannered as the demonstration was, it was also a sign of deeply felt worry. Never in the town's history had such a varied group united behind a single cause. The opposition included many retired Hershey company executives, including the silver-haired former chairman of the board, Richard Zimmerman, who stood to earn a fortune on his stock if the sale went forward. The retired executives were joined by union workers who stood with alumni of the Milton Hershey School. Men who once designed ad campaigns for Hershey bars developed antisale propaganda. Schoolchildren marched beside doctors, lawyers, and local politicians. </p><p> At a rally, alumni leader Ric Fouad shouted, "We're not here to mourn, we're here to mobilize!" Onlookers waved placards that read, "Power to the People!" and "Save Our Town!" </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> The idea of selling the Hershey company was born of good intentions. Board members of the Milton Hershey School Trust, which held a controlling interest in what was formally called the Hershey Foods Corporation, had decided that the charity's dependence on the firm's stock was unwise. American securities markets were in the middle of a long steep decline. Some major companies -- WorldCom, Enron, etc. -- were collapsing in scandal and leaving investors with pennies on the dollar. Looking at the perilous markets, the board members secretly decided to sell the trust's stake in Hershey and invest the windfall in a more diverse portfolio. </p><p> Although other charities held big stakes in corporations, the situation in Hershey was unusual. For one thing, the trust was devoted to a single enterprise: an eleven-hundred-pupil residential school for needy children. For another, the value of the trust was enormous. Estimated at $5 billion, it was already eight times larger than the endowment of Phillips Exeter Academy, the nation's next-richest school. Indeed, only six universities held larger endowments, which meant that the Milton Hershey School was richer than Cornell, Columbia, or the University of Pennsylvania. </p><p> But as big as it was, the trust was unusually vulnerable because a crash in one company's stock price would do enormous damage to its portfolio. The diversification that a sale would make possible would reduce this risk. It could also produce a onetime windfall. Bidders would recognize that Hershey's many brands, which included Reese's, York, and Jolly Ranchers candies, had been underexploited. Properly managed, which might mean breaking the company into pieces, the whole lot might be worth not $5 billion but closer to $10 billion. </p><p> From a fiduciary standpoint, selling the company was in the interest of the trust and the Milton Hershey School. And the timing was right. The big global companies that dominated the candy business -- Nestl�, Cadbury-Schweppes, Kraft -- were in a buying mood. If the trust board didn't consider selling, it would fail to meet its duty to the institution and its students. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> As much as the residents of Hershey cared about the needy children at the school, they had a hard time believing that a sale was necessary. Even without maximizing its investment, the trust's income far exceeded the board's ability to spend it every year. Not that they didn't try. They had built lavish facilities, expanded enrollment, and hired top-notch staff. With the cost of building maintenance factored in, they spent about $100,000 per year per child. And still the excess revenues piled up. How much more could the school need? </p><p> With the trust already rich, opponents of the sale thought the board was asking the community to make an unnecessary sacrifice. Roughly six thousand people held jobs in the company, including about three thousand unionized factory workers. A new owner was likely to see that bigger profits could be had if manufacturing were consolidated in other places, where wages, taxes, and other costs were lower. If the factories were moved, the jobs would be very difficult to replace. The change would also affect tourism and the very identity of the community. What's a chocolate town without a chocolate plant? </p><p> The town of Hershey had been created first in the imagination of the chocolate industrialist Milton S. Hershey, who then made it real in a place where there had been little more than a few farmhouses and acres of corn. The chocolate factory, the school, and the town were supposed to make up a self-perpetuating little utopia of capitalism and charity, and all three had thrived for ninety-nine years by adhering to his vision. </p><p> The idealism of Milton S. Hershey was cited over and over again by those who tried to stop the sale. With no real authority in the matter -- private trusts are not required to answer to the public -- they appealed to state officials and the court of public opinion. To do this, they put together a story that described the trustees as greedy and heartless outsiders who didn't understand the destruction they would visit on the town. They then welcomed the national media. </p><p> The reporters who came to Hershey saw a tableau of small-town America that was as appealing as the dream M.S., as he was known, held in his mind when he created his factory and his community. And like so many visitors before them, they agreed with the writer who, in the midst of the Great Depression, observed the town of Hershey's stubborn prosperity and isolation and declared it "a 10,000 acre world of its own." </p><p> Not one journalist missed the opportunity to flavor the story with references to the town's peculiarities and charming asides about chocolate. By the time the press was through, the entire nation would understand that a uniquely benevolent and impossibly cute village, which called itself "the Sweetest Place on Earth," was being bullied out of its dreamy existence by coldhearted money managers. </p><p> "They're threatening to tear the soul out of this community," one community leader told <i>The Wash...</i></p></p><h2>American Medical Association Home Medical Encyclopedia: An A-Z Reference Guide to over 5000 Medical Terms</h2><p>In easy-to-understand language, this comprehensive guide covers common and uncommon disorders, diseases, their symptoms and treatments, diagnosis, and drugs</p><p></p><h2>Drawn Into the Heart of Reading: Student Book (Level 4-5)</h2><p>Recommended for students in grades 2-8.

From the dream that preceded the game-winning shot against Georgetown in the 1982 NCAA Finals to the methodical dissection of the Utah Jazz prior to his game-winning shot in Game 6 of the 1998 Finals, Jordan pulls back the curtain on one of the most remarkable lives this century.</p><p>It's not easy imagining a volume capable of capturing the grace, the joy, the flamboyance, and the wizardry of Michael Jordan, but this hybrid--melding autobiography, celebration, spectacular photography, and cutting-edge graphics--comes awfully close. Like Jordan driving the lane, it's a thing of beauty; harder to analyze than it is to admire, accept, gaze at, and enjoy.<p> As befits the ultimate star in a game that has marketed itself with perfect razzle-dazzle, <i>For the Love of the Game</i> is as visually brash as it is glitzy. In page after stunning page, Jordan traces his ascension from college star to object of worldwide adoration. While most of the focus is, of course, on the NBA, there are significant side trips into baseball, the 1992 Olympic Dream Team, his advertising omnipresence, his family, and even his privacy. On the surface, the pictures--and their presentation--are more than enough to preserve and praise the Jordan legend, but <i>For the Love of the Game</i> has something more. It has Michael Jordan. </p><p> Jordan's text is everything the flashy images are not; it is straight, thoughtful, and revealing. At times, the relationship of word and image is breathtaking, especially on a particular pair of two-page layouts. In the first, Jordan asks, "When does jumping become flying?" His answer, framed by photos that would turn Superman green with envy, indicates that Jordan is genuinely amazed by his own talents. The second is his reflection on "The Shot," his buzzer-beater over Cleveland's Craig Ehlo to win game 5 in the 1989 playoffs. The story is told in 24 pictures taken over the final three seconds. Below that is a chart of 25 of Jordan's game-winning shots. But it's this Jordan observation that pulls the image and text together: "I never considered the negative consequence of missing the last shot in a game." It's an attitude that defines the man, and <i>For the Love of the Game</i> reflects it with a stylish combination of elegance, power, and beauty. (Want more Jordan?

H. Auden, Anton Chekov, Pablo Neruda, Ernest Hemingway, Flannery O&#39;Connor, Raymond Carver, May Sarton, and others. 15,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Richard C. Reynolds, M.D.,</b> is Courtesy Professor of Medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine. He was formerly Executive Vice President of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. A graduate of Rutgers University and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, he did postgraduate training at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. After spending a number of years in private practice of internal medicine, he held academic appointments at the University of Florida College of Medicine and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.<b>Introduction</b><p><i></i></p><blockquote><i>It's the humdrum, day-in, day-out, everyday work that is the real satisfaction of the practice of medicine; the million and a half patients a man has seen on his daily visits over a forty-year period of weekdays and Sundays that make up his life. I have never had a money practice; it would have been impossible for me. But the actual calling on people, at all times and under all conditions, the coming to grips with the intimate conditions of their lives, when they were being born, when they were dying, watching them die, watching them get well when they were ill, has always absorbed me.</i></blockquote><p>In these few sentences from William Carlos Williams's autobiography, he has captured very well the human splendor of medicine. We have tried to do the same in compiling this anthology, which contains stories, poems, essays, excerpts, and memoirs. In the process of caring for their patients, physicians have a unique -- and privileged -- window on the full range of human emotions. Literature, too, is rich in its descriptions of individual illnesses and plagues, in its capacity to reveal patients' reactions to illness and doctors' dilemmas in providing care. In its own way, literature defines the medical profession and fits into the larger society. Legacies and traditions, which are an important part of medicine, are often best manifested in the literature of a given period of history. Many of our selections were written by physicians. Williams and Anton Chekhov, W. Somerset Maugham and Lewis Thomas are only a few of the physician-writers who have relied on their medical backgrounds to help them understand better the frailties and strengths, the wonderment of the human condition. Some carried on a lifelong practice of medicine while simultaneously achieving literary recognition. Dr. Williams is a fine example -- his work, it seems fair to say, changed the face of American poetry, even as he carried on a large medical practice (he delivered over three thousand babies, for example). Somerset Maugham, although he discontinued his medical practice after internship, gave full credit to the experience in his autobiographical <i>The Summing Up</i>: "I do not know a better training for a writer than to spend some years in the medical profession." Others, so well known for their writing, were also trained in the medicine of their day. It is not generally known, for example, that the Romantic poet John Keats did a five-year apprenticeship with a surgeon. During those years he delivered so many babies that he was not required to take obstetrics and gynecology during the hospital phase of his training.</p><p>Of course, one need not be trained in medicine in order to make cogent and crucial observations about what it is like to be sick, hence vulnerable; to witness and record the isolation and alienation that comes eventually to all of us -- finally, we are all patients. Consider the poems of the late Jane Kenyon and her husband, Donald Hall. Their writings poignantly describe the time before their ultimate separation by her death, in 1995. Their poems are human documents without parallel. In his compelling short story "The Immortals," Jorge Luis Borges (also not a physician) comments trenchantly and presciently on some of the major ethical dilemmas of our time, those centering on organ transplants and utilization of scarce medical resources.</p><p>We have included many poems in this anthology. Poems recommend themselves to the editors of such a work because of their economy of form: in a few words a poem can communicate a complete experience. Read aloud Margaret Atwood's "The Woman Who Could Not Live with Her Faulty Heart." In its rhythms one can hear the heart, first regular, then skipping. Or listen to the courage embodied in James Dickey's "The Cancer Match." Read Emily Dickinson's short poems, which transcend time and place to speak to us in completely modern -- and human -- terms. And share with Patricia Goedicke (in "One More Time") the universal experience of having an X ray taken: "When the technician says breathe / I breathe."</p><p>Nor have we neglected the wisdom gathered in essays from major clinical figures and teachers over the years; hence, Lewis Thomas's "House Calls" is included. We begin this book, in fact, with just such an essay, one that impressed us from the first time we encountered it in the pages of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>: Carola Eisenberg's "It Is Still a Privilege to Be a Doctor." The reader will find his or her own favorites among the many others we have included.</p><p>This third edition of <i>On Doctoring</i> provided us with the chance to add other voices to those previously included: remarkable writing from physician-writers Mikhail Bulgakov and Susan Onthank Mates, for example. Many writers new to this anthology are well known and widely published: Rainer Maria Rilke, Mary Oliver, Paul Zimmer, Donald Justice, Derek Mahon, and Jenny Joseph. We note with pride that our youngest author ever is included in these pages: Gregory Edwards was ten years old when he wrote his insightful -- and humorous -- poem called "The Shot."</p><p>Each one of us, of course, has a vast and vested interest in what goes on in the myriad arenas of medicine -- and in the nature of the individual doctor-patient encounters explored within the pages of this book. This is all to the good: physicians and patients must continue to talk and listen together -- and literature can help in that exchange. As editors, we are pleased to have had some part in this dialogue: prior editions of <i>On Doctoring</i> have had a combined readership of two hundred thousand.</p><p>Henry David Thoreau wrote, "To affect the quality of the day -- that is the highest of arts." Both medicine and literature have the capacity to affect the quality of the human day. Resonances between these two disciplines offer us a unique view of the human condition that neither one alone can provide. Read. And enjoy.</p><p><i></i></p><blockquote><blockquote><i>The Editors</i></blockquote></blockquote><p>Copyright � 1991, 1995, 2001 by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</p><p></p></p><h2>The Cat&#39;s Meow : Purr-Fect Quilts for Cat Lovers</h2><p>Quilters who fancy felines will love The Cat&#x2019;s Meow!

The Maryland town her father built has too many sad memories and Abby too few spare moments, thanks to her demanding Wall Street career, the crumbling of her marriage and energetic twin daughters. Then one panicked phone call from her youngest sister brings her racing back home to protect Jess's dream of renovating the charming Inn at Eagle Point.<br><br>But saving the inn from foreclosure means dealing not only with her own fractured family, but also with Trace Riley, the man Abby left ten years ago. Trace can be a roadblock to her plans...or proof that second chances happen in the most unexpected ways.<br><br></p><p><p>With her roots firmly planted in the South, Sherryl Woods has written many of her more than 100 books in that distinctive setting, whether in her home state of Virginia, her adopted state, Florida, or her much-adored South Carolina. Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.</p><br><br>Being an overachiever sucked, Abby O'Brien Winters concluded as she crawled into bed after midnight, mentally and physically exhausted after a roller-coaster day on Wall Street. She'd managed about twenty minutes of quality time with her twin daughters before they'd fallen asleep barely into the opening paragraph of <em>The Velveteen Rabbit. </em>She'd eaten warmed-over Chinese takeout for the third straight night, then pulled out a half-dozen voluminous market analysts' reports she needed to absorb before the stock exchange opened in the morning. Her bedtime reading was a lot more challenging than what Caitlyn and Carrie chose.<br><br>She was good at her job as a portfolio manager for a major brokerage company, but so far it had cost her a marriage to a great guy, who'd tired of playing second fiddle to her career, and more sleep than she could possibly calculate. Though she shared custody of the twins with Wes, she often felt as if she was barely acquainted with her five-year-old daughters. It sometimes seemed as if they spent more time with the nanny&#x2014;and even her ex-husband&#x2014;than they did with her. She'd long since lost sight of exactly what she was trying to prove and to whom.<br><br>When the phone rang, Abby glanced at the clock and groaned. At this hour, it could only be an emergency. Heart thudding, she reached for the receiver.<br><br>"Abby, it's me," her sister Jessica announced. Jess was the youngest of the five O'Brien siblings and the real night owl among them. Abby stayed up late because it was the only way to cram enough work into a twenty-four-hour day. Jess did it because she was just starting to hit her stride when the moon and stars came out. "I called earlier, but the nanny said you weren't home yet. Then I got distracted with a project I'm working on. I hope it's not too late. I know you're usually up till all hours."<br><br>"It's fine," Abby assured her. "Is everything okay? You sound stressed. Is something going on with Gram? Or Dad?"<br><br>"Gram's amazing. She'll outlive us all. And Dad is off someplace building something. I can't keep track of him."<br><br>"He was in California last week," Abby recalled.<br><br>"Then I guess he's still there. You know he has to oversee every single detail when one of his projects is being built. Of course, then he loses interest, just the way he did with Chesapeake Shores."<br><br>There was an unsurprising note of bitterness in Jess's voice. As the youngest of five, she, more than the rest of them, had missed spending time with their dad. Mick O'Brien had already been making a name for himself as an architect and urban planner when he'd designed and built Chesapeake Shores, a now-famous seaside community on the Chesapeake Bay. He'd done it in partnership with his brothers&#x2014;one a builder, the other an environmentalist. The town had been built around land that had been farmed by Colin O'Brien, a great-great uncle and the first of the O'Briens to arrive from Ireland in the late 1800s. It was to be the crown jewel in Mick's body of work and the idyllic place his family would call home. It hadn't turned out that way.<br><br>Mick and his brothers had fought over the construction, battled over environmental issues and even over the preservation of the few falling-down historic buildings on some of the property. Eventually they'd dissolved the partnership. Now, even though they all coexisted in or near Chesapeake Shores, they seldom spoke except on holidays, when Gram insisted on a pretense of family harmony.<br><br>Abby's mother, Megan, had lived in New York since she and Mick had divorced fifteen years ago. Though the plan had been for all of the children to move to New York with her, for reasons Abby had never understood, that hadn't happened. They'd stayed in Chesapeake Shores with their mostly absent dad and Gram. In recent years, one by one they had drifted away, except for Jess, who seemed to have a love-hate relationship with the town and with Mick.<br><br>Since moving to New York herself after college, Abby had reestablished a strong bond with her mother, but none of the others had done the same. And not just Jess, but all five of them had an uneasy relationship with their father. It was Gram&#x2014;who'd been only a girl when her family had followed their O'Brien predecessors to Maryland&#x2014;with her fading red hair, twinkling blue eyes, ready smile and the lingering lilt of Ireland in her voice, who held them together and made them a family.<br><br>"Did you call to complain about Dad, or is something else on your mind?" Abby asked her sister.<br><br>"Oh, I can always find something to complain about with Dad," Jess admitted, "but actually I called because I need your help."<br><br>"Anything," Abby said at once. "Just tell me what you need." She was close to all her siblings, but Jess held a special place in her heart, perhaps because of the big difference in their ages and her awareness of how their mother's departure and their father's frequent absences had affected her. Abby had been stepping in to fill that gap in Jess's life since the day Megan had left.<br><br>"Could you come home?" Jess pleaded. "It's a little too complicated to get into on the phone."<br><br>"Oh, sweetie, I don't know," Abby began, hesitating. "Work is crazy."<br><br>"Work is always crazy, which is exactly why you need to come home. It's been ages. Before the girls came along, you used work as an excuse. Then it was the twins. Now it's work <em>and </em>the twins."<br><br>Abby winced. It was true. She had been making excuses for years now. She'd eased her conscience with the fact that every member of her family loved visiting New York and came up frequently. As long as she saw them all often, it didn't seem to matter that it was almost always on her turf rather than Chesapeake Shores. She'd never stopped to analyze why it had been so easy to stay away. Maybe it was because it really hadn' t felt like home after her mother had left.<br><br>Before she could reply, Jess added, "Come on, Abby. When was the last time you took a real vacation? Your honeymoon, I'll bet. You know you could use a break, and the girls would love being here. They should spend some quality time in the town their grandfather built and where you grew up. Gram could spoil them rotten for a couple of weeks. Please. I wouldn't ask if it weren't important."<br><br>"Life-or-death important?" Abby asked. It was an old exchange, used to rank whether any crisis was truly monumental or only a temporary blip in their lives.<br><br>"It could be," Jess said seriously. "At least in the sense that my whole future's at stake. I think you're the only one who can fix this, or at least the only one I'm willing to ask for help."<br><br>Struck by the somber tone in her voice, Abby said, "Maybe you'd better tell me right now."<br><br>"You need to be here to understand. If you can't stay for a couple of weeks, then at least come for a few days. Please."<br><br>There was something in her sister's voice that Abby had never heard before, an urgency that suggested she wasn't exaggerating her claim that her future was at stake. Since Jess was the only one of the five siblings who'd been floundering for a focus since reaching adulthood, Abby knew she couldn't turn her back on her. And admittedly a break would do Abby herself a world of good. Hadn't she just been bemoaning her workaholic tendencies earlier tonight?<br><br>She smiled, thinking about how wonderful it would be to breathe the salty Chesapeake Bay air again. Even better, she would have uninterrupted time with her girls in a place where they could swing on the playground her father had designed for the town park, build sand castles on the beach and run barefoot through the chilly waters of the bay.<br><br>"I'll work something out tomorrow and be down there by the weekend," she promised, giving in. She glanced at her jam-packed schedule and grimaced. "I can only make it for a couple of days, okay?"<br><br>"A week," Jess pleaded. "I don't think this can be fixed in a day or two."<br><br>Abby sighed. "I'll see what I can work out."<br><br>"Whatever you can arrange," Jess said at once, seizing the compromise. "Let me know when your flight's getting in and I'll pick you up."<br><br>"I'll rent a car," Abby said.<br><br>"After all these years in New York, do you actually remember how to drive?" Jess teased. "Or even how to get home?"<br><br>"My memory's not that bad," Abby responded. "See you soon, sweetie."<br><br>"I'll call Gram and let her know you're coming."<br><br>"Tell her not to go to any trouble, okay?" Abby said, knowing it would be a waste of breath. "We'll go out to eat. I've been dying for some Maryland crabs."<br><br>"No way," her sister countered. "It's a little early in the season, but if you want steamed crabs, I'll find 'em somewhere and pick them up for Friday-night dinner. We can eat on the porch, but I'm not about to stop Gram from cooking up a storm. I say let the baking begin."<br><br>Abby laughed at her enthusiasm. Gram's baking&#x2014;pies, tarts, cookies, scones, cakes&#x2014;was pretty amazing. There'd been a time in her life when Abby had wanted to learn all those traditional family recipes and open a bakery, but that was before she'd discovered an interest in and aptitude for the financial world. That had been her ticket out of Chesapeake Shores.<br><br>Now, after more than ten hectic years away&#x2014;years spent climbing a treacherous corporate ladder, marrying, giving birth to twins and divorcing&#x2014;she was going home for a real visit, something longer than a rushed weekend with barely time to relax before it was time to fly back to New York. She couldn't help wondering, based on the dire tone in Jess's voice, if that was a good thing or not.<br><br>"Couldn't you at least put on a tie?" Lawrence Riley grumbled, scowling at his son. "If you're going to take over this bank, you need to set a good example for the employees. You can't come in here looking as if you just climbed off the back of a Harley."<br><br>Trace regarded his father with amusement. "That's exactly what I did. My bike's in the parking lot."<br><br>His father's frown deepened. "I thought I told you to drive your mother's car. You have an image to uphold now."<br><br>"What was Mother supposed to do?" Trace asked reasonably. "I couldn't see her riding my Harley to her garden club meeting."<br><br>"She has a dozen different friends who would have been happy to pick her up," his father countered.<br><br>"And apparently not a one of them had any desire to run all her errands with her after the meeting," Trace responded.<br><br>"You have an answer for everything, don't you?" his father grumbled. "This situation is never going to work if you don't take me or this job seriously."<br><br>"I always take you seriously," Trace said. "As for the job, I don't want to take it at all. I have a perfectly good career in New York. Just because I don't have to wear a suit or use a calculator doesn't mean it's not respectable." In fact, his career as a freelance design artist not only paid well, enabling him to live and work in a large loft in SoHo, it didn't require him to answer to his father. That was quite a perk in his book.<br><br>His father's scowl deepened. "So, what? I should let this community bank get gobbled up by one of the big banking conglomerates?"<br><br>"Maybe so," Trace said, knowing his response would only push his father's hot button. "That's the way the banking world is going."<br><br>"Well, <em>this </em>bank won't, not as long as I have any say about it," his father said stubbornly. "Chesapeake Shores Community Bank serves the people in this town in a way that one of those faceless, impersonal behemoths never could."<br><br>Trace couldn't argue the point. He just didn't want any part of running the place, family heritage or not. "Why not put Laila in charge?" he asked, referring to his younger sister. He warmed to the topic. If he could convince his father to put Laila in the job she'd always wanted, he could be on the road back to New York by morning. All he had to do was sell his father on the idea. "Think about it, Dad. She has a head for numbers. Her SAT math scores were through the roof. She aced all of her college business courses. She has a master's degree from the Wharton School of Business. She'd be a natural."<br><br>"I thought of that," his father admitted. "I even spoke to her about it, but your sister told me to take a hike."<br><br>That was unexpected, Trace thought. "Why?"<br><br>His father shrugged. "She said she wasn't going to be anybody's second choice, even mine."<br><br>Trace regarded him with bewilderment. "But you asked her first."<br><br>"When has your sister ever paid any attention to logic? She's convinced I only asked her because I knew you wouldn't want the job."<br><br>"I don't suppose you tried to convince her she was wrong," Trace said.<br><br>"How could I when she was right?"<br><br>"Do you think you two will ever learn to communicate?" Trace grumbled. He and his dad might be at loggerheads ninety percent of the time, but Lawrence Riley and Laila were rarely on the same page about anything, from a choice as inane as breakfast cereal to a decision as critical as who ought to run the bank. It had been that way from the moment she learned to talk.<br><br>"You mean communicate the way you and I do?" his father retorted wryly.<br><br>"Yeah, at least that well," Trace responded. "Look, I'll talk to her. I'll smooth things over between the two of you. Her pride's been hurt because you've made it plain over the years that you want me back here, but she'll come around."<br><br>His father hit his fist on the desk. "Dammit, you're the one who needs to come around, Trace. What ever happened to family loyalty? A man works his whole life to build up something good for his son, and you toss it aside without a second thought."<br><br>"I've had a lifetime to think about it. You've never made a secret about what you expected. I've given it a second thought and a third, for that matter, ever since you called. Dad, come on, you know the whole nine-to-five drill would never work for me. I like a job that's creative, a word that tends to make bankers nervous as hell."<br><br>The faint hint of a smile finally touched his father's lips. "True enough," he admitted. "How about this? We give it six months. If you still hate it, you can take off again with my blessing. That's fair, isn't it?"<br><br>As a respected and in-demand artist working freelance for several of New York's top ad agencies, Trace had the flexibility to do as his father asked. He could even keep up with a few accounts to keep himself from going totally stir-crazy in Chesapeake Shores. If it would buy him his freedom permanently, surely he could survive six months in a suit. He owed his father that much respect. And in the long run that short-term display of loyalty would be wiser than causing a family rift.<br><br>Moreover, he could spend the time trying to convince his sister to forget about her stupid pride and being second choice. She'd wanted this job since she'd learned to count. She ought to grab it, rather than wasting her talent by keeping the books for a few local businesses. Unfortunately she'd inherited their father's stubbornness. It would probably take Trace every single day of the allotted six months to make peace between the two of them.<br><br>"Okay, six months," Trace agreed. "Not one day longer."<br><br>His father beamed at him. "We'll see. You might discover you have an aptitude for banking, after all."<br><br>"Or you'll realize I'm incompetent when it comes to math."<br><br>"I have your college test scores and grades that say otherwise." He stood up and held out his hand. "Welcome aboard, son."<br><br>Trace shook his hand, then studied his father intently. There was a glint in his eyes that suggested there was more to the negotiations than Trace had realized.

Set mostly in Paris and Manhattan in the desperately glittering 1980s, it has the timeless depth and moral power of a fairy tale.<br><br>As a teenager on the streets of San Francisco, Alison is discovered by a photographer and swept into the world of fashion-modeling in Paris and Rome. When her career crashes and a love affair ends disastrously, she moves to New York City to build a new life. There she meets Veronica&#x2014;an older wisecracking eccentric with her own ideas about style, a proofreader who comes to work with a personal &#x201c;office kit&#x201d; and a plaque that reads &#x201c;Still Anal After All These Years.&#x201d; Improbably, the two women become friends. Their friendship will survive not only Alison&#x2019;s reentry into the seductive nocturnal realm of fashion, but also Veronica&#x2019;s terrible descent into the then-uncharted realm of AIDS. The memory of their friendship will continue to haunt Alison years later, when she, too, is aging and ill and is questioning the meaning of what she experienced and who she became during that time. <br><br>Masterfully layering time and space, thought and sensation, Mary Gaitskill dazzles the reader with psychological insight and a mystical sense of the soul&#x2019;s hurtling passage through the world. A novel unlike any other, <i>Veronica</i> is a tour de force about the fragility and mystery of human relationships, the failure of love, and love&#x2019;s abiding power. It shines on every page with depth of feeling and formal beauty.</p><p><b>Mary Gaitskill</b> is most recently the author of <i>Because They Wanted To</i>, which was nominated for the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1998.

She read it to me and my two sisters. We sat curled against her on the couch and she read from the book on her lap. The lamp shone on us and there was a blanket over us. The girl in the story was beautiful and cruel. Because her mother was poor, she sent her daughter to work for rich people, who spoiled and petted her. The rich people told her she had to visit her mother. But the girl felt she was too good and went merely to show herself. One day, the rich people sent her home with a loaf of bread for her mother. But when the little girl came to a muddy bog, rather than ruin her shoes, she threw down the bread and stepped on it. It sank into the bog and she sank with it. She sank into a world of demons and deformed creatures. Because she was beautiful, the demon queen made her into a statue as a gift for her great-grandson. The girl was covered in snakes and slime and surrounded by the hate of every creature trapped like she was. She was starving but couldn't eat the bread still welded to her feet. She could hear what people were saying about her; a boy passing by saw what had happened to her and told everyone, and they all said she deserved it. Even her mother said she deserved it. The girl couldn't move, but if she could have, she would've twisted with rage. "It isn't fair!" cried my mother, and her voice mocked the wicked girl.<br><br> Because I sat against my mother when she told this story, I did not hear it in words only. I felt it in her body. I felt a girl who wanted to be too beautiful. I felt a mother who wanted to love her. I felt a demon who wanted to torture her. I felt them mixed together so you couldn't tell them apart. The story scared me and I cried. My mother put her arms around me. "Wait," she said. "It's not over yet. She's going to be saved by the tears of an innocent girl. Like you." My mother kissed the top of my head and finished the story. And I forgot about it for a long time.<br> I open my eyes.<br><br> I can't sleep. When I try, I wake after two hours and then spend the rest of the night pulled around by feelings and thoughts. I usually sleep again at dawn and then wake at 7:30. When I wake, I'm mad at not sleeping, and that makes me mad at everything. My mind yells insults as my body walks itself around. Dream images rise up and crash down, huge, then gone, huge, gone. A little girl sinks down in the dark. Who is she? Gone.<br><br> I drink my coffee out of a heavy blue mug, watching the rain and listening to a fool on a radio show promote her book. I live right on the canal in San Rafael and I can look out on the water. There're too many boats on it and it's filthy with gas and garbage and maybe turds from the boats. Still, it's water, and once I saw a sea lion swimming toward town.<br><br> Every day, my neighbor Freddie leaps off his deck and into the canal for a swim. This disgusts my neighbor Bianca. "I asked him, 'Don't you know what's in there? Don't you know it's like swimming in a public toilet?'" Bianca is a sexy fifty-year-old, sexy even though she's lost her looks, mainly because of her big fat lips. "He doesn't care; he says he just takes a hot shower after." Bianca draws on her cigarette with her big lips. "Probably get typhoid." She blows out with a neat turn of her head; even her long ropy neck is sort of sexy. "I hate the sight of him flying through the air in that little Speedo, God!"<br><br> Sure enough, while I'm looking out the window, Freddie, all red and fleshy, with his stomach hanging down and his silver head tucked between his upstretched arms, vaults through the air and--wap!--hits the water like a bull roaring in the field. I can just see Bianca downstairs muttering "Shit!" and slamming the wall with her fist. He's a big fifty-something, with a huge jaw and muscles like lumps of raw meat just going to fat. His round eyes show one big emotion at a time: Joy. Anger. Pain. Fear. But his body is full of all those things happening at once, and that's what you see when he's swimming. He attacks the water with big pawing strokes, burying his face in it like he's trying to eat it out. Then he stops and treads water, his snorting head tossing and bobbing for a second before he turns and lies down in the water, like a kid, with total trust--ah!--face to the sky, regardless of the rain or turds.<br><br> Even though he's big, Freddie's got the face of somebody who's been beat too many times, like his face is just out there to be beat. He's also got the face of somebody who, after the beating is done, gets up, says "Okay," and keeps trying to find something good to eat or drink or roll in. He likes to end stories by saying, "But they'd probably just tell you I'm an a-s-s-h-o-l-e," like, Oh well, what's on TV? That's the thing Bianca hates most, that beat-up but still leaping out into the turds for a swim quality. Especially the leaping: It's like a personal affront to her. But I like it. It reminds me of the sea lion, swimming into town with its perfect round head sticking up--even though the lion is gliding and Freddie is rough. It's like something similar put in different containers. Sometimes I want to say this to Bianca, to defend Freddie. But she won't listen. Besides, I understand why he disgusts her. She's a refined person, and I like refinement, too. I understand it as a point of view.<br><br> The writer on the radio is talking about her characters like they're real people: "When you look at it from her point of view, his behavior really is strange, because to her, they're just playing a sexy game, whereas for him it's--" She blooms out of the radio like a balloon with a face on it, smiling, wanting you to like her, vibrating with things to say. Turn on the radio, there's always somebody like her on somewhere. People rushing through their lives turn the dial looking for comfort, and the excited smiling words spill over them. I drink my coffee. The novelist's characters dance and preen. I drink my coffee. People from last night's dream stumble in dark rooms, screaming at one another, trying hard to do something I can't see. I finish my coffee. Water is seeping in and soaking the edge of the carpet. I don't know how this happens, I'm on the second floor.<br><br> It's time for me to go clean John's office. John is an old friend, and as a favor, he pays me to clean his office every week. Into my patchwork bag I pack the necessaries--aspirin, codeine, bottle of water--then I look for my umbrella. When I find it, I realize it's broken, and I curse before I remember the other one, the red one from New York that I never use. I got it at the Museum of Modern Art gift shop when I lived in Manhattan. It has four white cartoon sheep, plus one black one, printed on its edge, along with the name of the museum. The decoration is precious and proper, and it reminds me of Veronica Ross. She is someone from my old life. She loved anything precious and proper: small intricate toys, photographs in tiny decorated frames, quotes from Oscar Wilde. She loved MoMA and she loved New York. She wore shoulder pads, prissy loafers, and thin socks. She rolled her trouser cuffs in this crisp way. On her glass-topped coffee table, she had miniature ashtrays, gilt matchboxes, and expensive coasters decorated with smiling cats.<br><br> When I go out into the hallway, Rita is there in her housecoat and slippers, holding a little plate of fried chicken livers. She offers me some, says she made too many last night. They smell good, so I take one and eat it while I talk to Rita. She says that last week "that son of a bitch Robert" fired up the barbecue again, on the puny deck right under hers, sending up poisonous charcoal fumes, which, she has explained time and again, are terrible for her hepatitis.<br><br> "I knew he still had that grill out there, and sure enough, the sun came out and I heard him mobilize it. I heard the charcoal in the bag. I heard him slide the lid off. I sat down and I meditated. I asked for help. I asked, What is the most powerful force in the world? And the answer came to me: Water."<br><br> Rita has hepatitis C; so do I. We don't discuss it much; she doesn't remind me that codeine by the fistful is like dropping a bomb on my liver. I don't remind her that while charcoal smoke is not a problem, her fried-food diet is.<br><br> "I filled every pot, every pan, every jar, glass, and vase, and I set them all out on the edge of the deck. And as soon as he fired it up--"<br><br> "You didn't!"<br><br> "I did. I doused the grill, and when he cursed me out, I doused him. He just stood there a second, and then you know what? He laughed! He said, 'Rita, you are a pisser.' He liked it!"<br><br> We talk a minute more; I laugh and say good-bye, step outside onto the wooden stairs. I snap open the umbrella and remember the last time I visited Veronica. She served me brownies in pink wrapping paper, fancy cheese, and sliced fruit she was too sick to eat. I said, "I don't think you love yourself. You need to learn to love yourself."<br><br> Veronica was silent for a long moment. Then she said, "I think love is overrated. My parents loved me. And it didn't do any good."<br><br> My street is all functional apartment buildings set back from the sidewalk. White plus a few black people live here. Two blocks down, it's semifunctional buildings and Mexicans. Turn the corner and it's warehouses, auto-body repair shops, and a bar with music coming out of it at 8:00 in the morning. Blunt, faceless buildings that are too much trouble to tear down. Grass and weeds and little bushes silently press up between the buildings and through every crack in the c...</p><h2>The Way Things Work</h2><p>The Way Things Work</p><p></p><h2>Inner Wisdom: Meditations for the Heart and Soul</h2><p>Louise has compiled gems of truth to help you awaken and tap into your own Inner Wisdom -- changing your beliefs, which will change your world.

After five years of intensive research and interviewing, Sally Denton and Roger Morris make clear how and why Las Vegas became the greatest "business success story" of the twentieth century, and how the rest of America ensured this success by contributing capital as well as customers.<br><br>Headquarters of a trillion-dollar worldwide empire, the site of unprecedented political and economic power, Las Vegas, in the view of Denton and Morris, is by no means an aberrant sin city. They demonstrate how, on the contrary, it has grown out of, and reflects, a corruption and a worship of money that have crept into American life since Prohibition.<br><br>They trace the original funds for the founding of the Las Vegas we know today to nationwide narcotics trafficking. They show how deeply a multiethnic criminal syndicate, in part feeding off gambling profits and the skim in Las Vegas, came to influence American politics and the larger society, and how pervasively its "style of business" has penetrated the entire nation. <br><br>Denton and Morris detail the amazing rise and reach of Meyer Lansky&#x2014;the mind that ran the city; exactly how criminals, politicians, and businessmen worked together to control Las Vegas; the curious interplay of the city with the fates of Joseph, John F., and Robert Kennedy; how Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover vastly intensified the city&#x2019;s corruption; how Mormon bankers and Wall Street financiers have bankrolled and profited from casinos ruled by organized crime; how a handful of dedicated journalists and law enforcement officers were destroyed before they could expose the city&#x2019;s secrets.<br><br><b>The Money and the Power</b> is a detailed and illuminating chronicle of an extraordinary place and time&#x2014;<br>and a provocative reinterpretation of twentieth-century American history.</p><p>"There is no place like it. It is literally a beacon of Civilization.... Only Mecca inspires as many pilgrims." So write Sally Denton and Roger Morris about Las Vegas, Nevada, which emerged in the last years of the 20th century as America's fastest-growing city, and in the process, a family-entertainment and cultural center. But underlying that Las Vegas--and underlying the authors' fine narrative--is an older, decidedly less friendly city, one shaped by an "alliance of gamblers, gangsters, and government" to cater to every kind of human weakness. This Las Vegas, populated by notorious criminals, dangerous eccentrics, and ambitious empire-builders, exercised an extraordinary influence on the nation's politics and economy. Few presidents elected in the last century did not come calling on the desert city to secure funds and favors, even as Las Vegas's thriving economy came under the control of a handful of powerful men.<p> Full of strange episodes and characters, the history of Las Vegas is too little known. Denton and Morris's revisionist, past-as-prologue look at how Las Vegas came to be is a startling, original work that adds much to our understanding of recent American history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>&#x201c;The history of Vegas&#x2019;s dark underside . . . has seldom been so abundantly and compellingly told.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Washington Post Book World<br></i><br>&#x201c;Riveting. . .

They can if they know the mysterious Sucoh Sucop, a man who claims to have an enchanted box that can transform any toy into the real thing! Before you know it, the twins, along with their droopy-eared basset hound, Floopy, are soaring cross-country in a real-live Wright brothers biplane, which they name <i>Vin Fiz</i> (after Casey&#x2019;s favorite grape soda). But dangers lurk everywhere, and if the twins are to make it all the way to New York, their courage will have to make heroes of them many times over. Thank goodness they have the magical <i>Vin Fiz</i> on their side!</p><p>Clive Cussler is the author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, most recently <i>The Spy</i> and <i>Lost Empire</i>. He lives in Arizona.Grade 3-5&#x2013;Cusslers first childrens book is a tribute to an airplane that crossed the United States in 1911. It is the tale of Casey and Lacey Nicefolk, who receive a gift from a hired hand that allows them to make their toys real and life-sized. First the twins make a tractor for their parents farm, and then they use the magic to create an airplane designed by the Wright brothers that they call <i>Vin Fiz</i>. They decide to fly across the country to New York. On the way, they rescue townspeople who have been turned into gold-mining slaves by an evil man, keep a steamboat from crashing into a barge, stop a runaway train, and rescue two girls from going over Niagara Falls in a boat. Unfortunately, the book suffers from a lack of characterization as well as problems with gender stereotypes. Lacey, the female twin, is never the hero in the adventures. The writing is stilted and the story fails to come to life even though the situations have the potential to be exciting.<i>&#x2013;Tasha Saecker, Caestecker Public Library, Green Lake, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Some are adventurers seeking danger from the back of their horses. Others are travelers discovering the beauties of the countryside they slowly ride through. A few are searching for inner truths while cantering across desolate parts of the planet. Then there is Messanie Wilkins. She was acting on orders from the Lord! In 1954, at the age of 63, Wilkins had plenty to worry about. A destitute spinster in ill health, Wilkins had been told she had less than two years left to live, provided she spent them quietly. With no family ties, no money, and no future in her native Maine, Wilkins decided to take a daring step. Using the money she had made from selling homemade pickles, Wilkins bought a tired summer camp horse and made preparations to ride from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific Ocean. Yet before leaving she flipped a coin, asking God to direct her to go or not. When the coin came up heads several times in a row, one of America&#x2019;s most unlikely equestrian heroines set off. What followed was one of the twentieth century's most remarkable equestrian journeys. Accompanied by her faithful horse, Tarzan, Wilkins suffered through a host of obstacles including blistering deserts and freezing snow storms, yet never lost faith that she would complete her 7,000 mile odyssey. &#x201c;Last of the Saddle Tramps&#x201d; is thus the warm and humorous story of a humble American heroine bound for adventure and the Pacific Ocean. The classic tale is amply illustrated with photographs.</p></p><p></p><h2>Widows Broom</h2><p>A widow finds herself in possession of an extraordinary broom left by a witch who fell into the widow&#39;s garden.</p><p>"Witches' brooms don't last forever. They grow old, and even the best of them, one day, lose the power of flight.... On very rare occasions, however, a broom can lose its power without warning, and fall, with its passenger, to the earth below ... which is just what happened one cold autumn night many years ago." So begins <i>The Widow's Broom</i>, the gentle, strangely captivating book by Chris Van Allsburg, who received Caldecott medals for <i>Jumanji</i> and <i>The Polar Express</i>.<p> The story gets under way when the lonely widow Minna Shaw finds a wounded, sky-fallen witch in her vegetable garden. The witch disappears before dawn, but leaves her old, presumably defunct broom behind. Minna begins to use it around the house and finds that "it was no better or worse than brooms she'd used before." However, one morning, Minna sees the broom sweeping by itself! Opportunistically, she trains it to chop wood and fetch water.</p><p> When the neighbors find out about this "wicked, wicked thing" (posing as an innocent, hardworking broom), they accost the widow and demand that the broom be burned.

Water, meat, and milk and other dairy products are filled with toxins, antibiotics, untested growth hormones, ammonia, and animal pus and manure. The current conditions of the food production industry must drastically improve, and until they do, it is absolutely vital to monitor what you eat.

Approximately half of the illnesses that claim American lives today are related to what we eat, and our health-care system is focused on treating the sick, not preventing illnesses from occurring. To fix our health problems, to continue feeding the world&#x2019;s ever-growing population, and to save our planet from ecological destruction, we can no longer avoid making changes to how American meat and dairy are produced.

Thank you. introduction: It&#39;s Not Easy Being an Artist in the Church Could you reach deep in yourself to locate that organ containing delusions about your general size in the world---could you lay hold of this and dredge it from your chest and look it over in daylight---well, it&#39;s no wonder people would rather not. Leif Enger, Peace Like a River In music school, I studied composition with an accomplished composer whom I deeply admired and respected. He knew I was involved in the music ministry at my church, but we rarely talked about it. Except, that is, for one brief moment near the end of my college career. During one of my lessons, several sheets of score paper accidentally fell out of my folder and onto the floor. As I gathered them up, my professor quickly noticed there was music he didn&#39;t recognize written on these sheets. When I explained the music was something I was working on for church, he grimaced and said, &#39;I thought you would have gotten this church thing out of your system by now.&#39; I shrugged my shoulders because I didn&#39;t know what to say. Then he asked, &#39;Why would anyone waste their time doing church music?&#39; That&#39;s an interesting question, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s one I&#39;ve asked myself often over the years. Why would an artist opt to share his or her talents with the church? After all, that&#39;s not usually the first place people think of when it comes to excellence or innovation in the arts. It&#39;s certainly not the place most artists think of when they dream about where they hope to express their talent. In fact, many artists are apprehensive about the church. They&#39;re afraid it might stifle or limit them, and they are concerned that church people won&#39;t accept or even understand them. Or that they won&#39;t fit in. Artists tend to be free spirits and nonconformists, and let&#39;s face it---that doesn&#39;t go over well at most churches. One of the most tragic examples of an artist mismatched with the church is the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. As a young man, van Gogh desperately desired to follow his father into the ministry. He trained for it, but he was not a good student. Nor was he good at public speaking---a definite problem for a potential preacher. Because of his dedication, an ecumenical Protestant organization gave him an opportunity to serve as a lay evangelist in a poor coal-mining town in what is now southwestern Belgium. While there, van Gogh became deeply concerned about the plight of these downtrodden people. He began to draw pictures of them, depicting their everyday chores, their work in the mines, and the hopelessness etched in their faces. Although van Gogh&#39;s superiors expressed admiration for the way he cared for his flock, they withdrew his appointment after six months, citing his deficient preaching skills. He tried to continue without their support but was soon living in abject poverty. Bitterly disappointed, van Gogh gave up his dream of becoming a minister and never set foot in a church again. He spent the rest of his life in extreme emotional, relational, and financial turmoil, which drove him to suicide at the age of thirty-seven. In 1889, a year before he died, Vincent van Gogh painted Starry Night (plate 1). Many regard this as his most spiritual work of art. To van Gogh, the evening sky symbolized God&#39;s presence, and the prominent cypress bush in the foreground appears to be reaching heavenward with fiery zeal. If you look closely at the buildings in the foreground, however, you&#39;ll notice all of them have light coming from the windows except one---the church. Furthermore, from an architectural standpoint, the Dutch Gothic steeple, similar to the one on the church van Gogh grew up in, is incongruous with the French countryside the painting represents. In another painting called Church at Auvers (1890), a cathedral is featured on a bright sunny day. But the church is dark and also appears to have no door. Van Gogh&#39;s feelings about the church are obvious---it&#39;s a cold, dark, close-minded place. One can&#39;t help but wonder how different van Gogh&#39;s life might have been had the church encouraged him to be what God obviously made him to be---an artist. I wish a caring Christ-follower had come alongside him and said, &#39;Hey, Vince, maybe preaching is not your thing. But God gave you this amazing ability to paint and draw, so why not serve God with your art instead of trying to be a preacher?&#39; I think that might actually have happened today, as the arts are playing an increasingly greater role in the ministry of the church. More and more artists are getting involved and experiencing the rewards of ministry. Still, we are also discovering just how difficult church work can be. Whenever I speak at a conference, it&#39;s not uncommon for an artist to pull me aside between sessions and ask me for advice on how to handle a troublesome situation at church. At some point in the conversation the person invariably says something like, &#39;I don&#39;t know how much more of this I can take. If things don&#39;t change, I don&#39;t know if I can survive another year.&#39; I receive many similar desperate cries for help through letters, emails, and phone calls from leaders and volunteers. They are overwhelmed by the challenges, worn down by the conflicts, and discouraged by the adversity involved in doing ministry in the church. It&#39;s hard enough being an artist, but being an artist in the church can be extremely challenging. In this book, we tackle those challenges head on. I don&#39;t have all the answers, but I have some experience to share that I hope you&#39;ll find encouraging and helpful. This is not a self-help book, however, with quick-fix formulas.</p><h2>If Tomorrow Comes</h2><p>Relying on her intelligence and beauty as her only weapons, Tracy Whitney embarks on a personal vendetta against the untouchable crime lords who framed her into a fifteen-year sentence in an escape-proof prison</p><p>She&#39;s Tracy Whitney, Sidney Sheldon&#39;s most exciting heroine ever.

The real facts emerge, but the fate of Bertrande and Martin remains open-ended.<br><br> In this new edition of Janet Lewis&#x2019;s classic short novel, The Wife of Martin Guerre, Swallow Press executive editor Kevin Haworth writes that Lewis&#x2019;s story is a short novel of astonishing depth and resonance, a sharply drawn historical tale that asks contemporary questions about identity and belonging, about men and women, and about an individual&#x2019;s capacity to act within an inflexible system.&#x201d; Originally published in 1941, The Wife of Martin Guerre has earned the respect and admiration of critics and readers for over sixty years.<br><br> Based on a notorious trial in sixteenth-century France, this story of Bertrande de Rols is the first of three novels making up Lewis&#x2019;s Cases of Circumstantial Evidence suite (the other two are <i>The Trial of S�ren Qvist </i>and <i>The Ghost of Monsieur Scarron</i>).<br><br> Swallow Press is delighted and honored to offer readers beautiful new editions of all three Cases of Circumstantial Evidence novels, each featuring a new introduction by Kevin Haworth.</p><p>Janet Lewis wrote many books of poetry and historical fiction, including The Wife of Martin Guerre.

This book strolls through the sorts of gardens that Jane Austen would have known and visited: the gardens of the great estates, cottage gardens, gardens in town, and public gardens and parks. Some of the gardens she owned or knew exist still in some form today; among the gardens highlighted is the restored garden at Jane Austen&#x2019;s House Museum in Chawton, England, complete with a sample planting plan of the flowers grown there now. The book also includes touring information for gardens featured in film adaptations of the novels. With lush photos, social history, excerpts from the novels, information on her life, and period drawings, this book brings Georgian and Regency gardens and Jane Austen&#x2019;s world to life. In the Garden with Jane Austen captures the essence and beauty of the traditional English garden. As the heroine of Mansfield Park Fanny Price observes, &#x201c;To sit in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure, is the most perfect refreshment.&#x201d;<br></p><p>KIM WILSON is an award-winning author, speaker, editor, tea lover, culinary historian, gardening enthusiast, and a passionate lover of the works and world of Jane Austen.

Famous for her London thrillers, such as&nbsp;<i>Hide My Eyes&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Tiger in the Smoke</i>, Margery Allingham has been compared to Dickens in her evocation of the city's shady underworld. Acclaimed by crime novelists such as P.D. James, Allingham is counted alongside Dorothy L. Sayers, Agatha Christie and Gladys Mitchell as a pre-eminent Golden Age crime writer.

This strange sub-genre encompasses the history of modern poetry, from its beginnings in romanticism (Bertrand, Turgenev, Baudelaire), its adolescence in Symbolism (Mallarme, Rimbaud, Trakl), its maturity in high modernism (Stein, Williams, Kafka, Montale, Follain, Char, Vallejo, H.D., and others), and its middle age in post-modernism (Cortazar, Bishop, Ashbery, Simic, Edson, Bly...) up to the present.</p><p>"An anthology whose long reach and articulate breadth make it an indispensable reference" -- <i>Rain Taxi</i></p><h2>Still Water: Prose Poems</h2><p>A series of autobiographical prose poems and interviews that explore Garfunkel&#39;s inner thoughts, musicial career, travels, and loves</p><p></p><h2>All God&#39;s Children Are Lost, but Only a Few Can Play the Piano: Finding a Life That Is Truly Your Own</h2><p>The author draws on legends, myths, folk tales, and his own experiences to address the problem of finding a personal identity in life that will lead to wholeness and inner peace</p><p>Kopp, a psychotherapist and author of several books, including An End to Innocence: Facing Life Without Illusions ( LJ 12/15/78) and Raise Your Right Hand Against Fear, Extend the Other in Compassion ( LJ 3/1/89), continues his tradition of writing about the inner self. Here, he seeks to help readers answer the questions "Who am I?" and "What is life's purpose?" He shows how others have dealt with uncertainty, crises, pain, and loss, while revealing how they did (or did not) come out with a better understanding of themselves. His illustrations are a mixture of personal experience (having personally lived with a brain tumor and heart condition for several years), clinical case studies, and biographical histories. All these examples are used adeptly to encourage the reader to take any necessary risk in order to meet one's true self.<br><i>-Joanna M. Thompson, Bluefield State Coll.

I haven&#x2019;t read it yet&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve just picked it up and casually glanced at the back cover. There clearly isn&#x2019;t a plot. I&#x2019;ve heard there&#x2019;s a lot of stuff about time travel in this book, and quite a bit about violence and Garth Brooks and why Germans don&#x2019;t laugh when they&#x2019;re inside grocery stores. Ralph Nader and Ralph Sampson play significant roles. I think there are several pages about <i>Rear Window </i>and college football and <i>Mad Men </i>and why Rivers Cuomo prefers having sex with Asian women. Supposedly there&#x2019;s a chapter outlining all the things the Unabomber was right about, but perhaps I&#x2019;m misinformed. </p><p><b>Q: Is there a larger theme? </b></p><p>A: Oh, something about reality. "What is reality," maybe? No, that&#x2019;s not it. Not exactly. I get the sense that most of the core questions dwell on the way media perception constructs a fake reality that ends up becoming more meaningful than whatever actually happened. Also, Lady Gaga. </p><p><b>Q: Should I read this book? </b></p><p></p><p>A: Probably. Do you see a clear relationship between the Branch Davidian disaster and the recording of Nirvana&#x2019;s <i>In Utero</i>? Does Barack Obama make you want to drink Pepsi? Does ABBA remind you of AC/DC? If so, you probably don&#x2019;t need to read this book. You probably wrote this book. But I suspect everybody else will totally love it, except for the ones who totally hate it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Chuck Klosterman is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of seven books, including <i>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs</i>; <i>Eating the Dinosaur</i>; and <i>The Visible Man</i>.

I would ask these strangers. It did not matter what it was. "What were you thinking while you did that? Did it satisfy you? What does it mean to be satisfied? Do you consider yourself to be famous? How does it feel to be famous? How did this experience change you? What elements didn't change? What will never change? What drives you? Are you lying to me right now? Why should I care about what you are saying? Is this all a construction? Are you constructed? Who constructed you? What was their purpose? Does God exist? Why or why not? Thank you very much. It was great meeting you in the lobby of this unnecessarily expensive hotel." </p><p> This has been a tremendous way to earn a living. Who wouldn't enjoy getting paid for being curious? Journalism allows almost anyone to direct questions they would never ask of their own friends at random people; since the ensuing dialogue exists for commercial purposes, both parties accept an acceleration of intimacy. People give emotional responses, but those emotions are projections. The result (when things go well) is a dynamic, adversarial, semi-real conversation. I am at ease with this. If given a choice between interviewing someone or talking to them "for real," I prefer the former; I don't like having the social limitations of tact imposed upon my day-to-day interactions and I don't enjoy talking to most people more than once or twice in my lifetime. </p><p> <b>2</b> For the past five years, I've spent more time being interviewed than conducting interviews with other people. I am not complaining about this, nor am I proud of it -- it's just the way things worked out, mostly by chance. But the experience has been confusing. Though I always understand why people ask me the same collection of questions, I never know why I answer them. Frankly, I don't know why anyone answers anything. The obvious explanation is that the interviewee is hoping to promote a product or a concept (or the "concept of themselves," which is its own kind of product), but that's reductive and often untrue; once a media entity makes the decision to conduct and produce an interview with a particular somebody, the piece is going to exist regardless of how the subject responds to the queries. The interviewee can say anything, even if those sentiments contradict reality. They can deliver nothing but clich�s, but the story will still run. On three occasions I've consciously (and blatantly) attempted to say boring things during an interview in the hope of killing the eventual article. It only worked once. But this type of behavior is rare. Most of the time, I pretend to be interesting. I try to frame my response in the context in which the question was asked, and I try to say things I haven't said before. But I have no clue as to why I do this (or why anyone else does, either). </p><p> During the summer of 2008, I was interviewed by a Norwegian magazine writer named Erik Moller Solheim. He was good at his job. He knew a lot of trivia about Finland's military history. We ate fried pork knees and drank Ur-Krostitzer beer. But in the middle of our playful conversation, I was suddenly paralyzed by an unspoken riddle I could not answer: Why was I responding to this man's questions? My books are not translated into Norwegian. If the journalist sent me a copy of his finished article, I could not read a word of it. I don't even know what the publication's name (<i>Dagens Naeringsliv</i>) is supposed to mean. I will likely never go to Norway, and even if I did, the fact that I was interviewed for this publication would have no impact on my time there. No one would care. The fjords would be underwhelmed. </p><p> As such, I considered the possible motives for my actions: </p><p> <b>1. I felt I had something important to say.</b> Except I did not. No element of our interaction felt important to me. If anything, I felt unqualified to talk about the things the reporter was asking me. I don't have that much of an opinion about why certain Black Metal bands burn down churches. </p><p> <b>2. It's my job.</b> Except that it wasn't. I wasn't promoting anything. In fact, the interaction could have been detrimental to my career, were I to have inadvertently said something insulting about the king of Norway. Technically, there was more downside than upside. </p><p> <b>3. I have an unconscious, unresolved craving for attention.</b> Except that this feels inaccurate. It was probably true twenty years ago, but those desires have waned. Besides, who gives a fuck about being famous in a country I'll never visit? Why would that feel good to anyone? How would I even know it was happening? </p><p> <b>4. I had nothing better to do.</b> This is accurate, but not satisfactory. </p><p> <b>5. I'm a nice person.</b> Unlikely. </p><p> <b>6. When asked a direct question, it's human nature to respond.</b> This, I suppose, is the most likely explanation. It's the crux of <i>Frost/Nixon</i>. But if this is true, why is it true? What is the psychological directive that makes an unanswered question discomfiting? </p><p> Why do people talk? </p><p> <b>3</b> <b>Why do people talk? Why do people answer the questions you ask them? Is there a unifying force that prompts people to respond?</b> </p><p> <b>Errol Morris:</b> Probably not, except possibly that people feel this need to give an account of themselves. And not just to other people, but to themselves. Just yesterday, I was being interviewed by a reporter from the <i>New York Observer</i>, and we were talking about whether or not people have privileged access to their own minds. </p><p> <b>Privileged access?</b> </p><p> <b>EM:</b> My mind resides somewhere inside of myself. That being the case, one would assume I have privileged access to it. In theory, I should be able to ask myself questions and get different answers than I would from other people, such as you. But I'm not sure we truly have privileged access to our own minds. I don't think we have any idea who we are. I think we're engaged in a constant battle to figure out who we are. I sometimes think of interviews as some oddball human relationship that's taking place in a laboratory setting. I often feel like a primatologist. </p><p> <b>Do you feel like you know the people that you interview? Because I feel as though I never do. It seems like a totally fake relationship.</b> </p><p> <b>EM:</b> I don't feel like I know myself, let alone the people I interview. I might actually know the people I interview <i>better</i> than I know myself. A friend of mine once said that you can never trust a person who doesn't talk much, because how else do you know what they're thinking? Just by the act of being willing to talk about oneself, the person is revealing something about who they are. </p><p> <b>But what is the talker's motive? Why did you decide to talk to the <i>New York Observer</i>? Why are you talking to me right now?</b> </p><p> <b>EM:</b> Well, okay. Let's use the example of Robert McNamara. Why does McNamara feel the need to talk to me -- or to anyone -- at this point in his life? Because there's a very strong human desire to do so. It might be to get approval from someone, even if that person is just me. It might even be to get a sense of condemnation from people. Maybe it's just programmed into us as people. McNamara also had this weird "approach-avoidance" thing: He agreed to do the interview because he assumed I was part of the promotion of his [then new] book. I called him around the same time his book was coming out, and he thought it was just part of that whole deal. When he realized it was not, he became apprehensive and said he didn't think he was going to do it. But then he did, and it went on for well over a year. In fact, I continued to interview him for a long time after that movie was finished, just because I found it very interesting. </p><p> <b>But why did McNamara keep talking?</b> </p><p> <b>EM:</b> He said he enjoyed talking to me. That was his explanation. </p><p> <b>2A</b> While working for newspapers during the 1990s, I imagined that being interviewed by other reporters would be fun. I assumed answering questions would be easier than asking them. This proved completely untrue. The process of being interviewed is much more stressful than the process of interrogating someone. If you make a mistake while you're interviewing someone else, there is no penalty (beyond the fact that it will be harder to write a complete story). But if you make a mistake while being interviewed -- if you admit something you'd prefer to keep secret, or if you flippantly answer a legitimately serious question, or if you thoughtlessly disparage a peer you barely know, or if you answer the phone while on drugs -- that mistake will inevitably become the focus of whatever is written. As a reporter, you live for those anecdotal mistakes. Mistakes are where you find hidden truths. But as a person, anecdotal mistakes define the experience of being misunderstood; anecdotal mistakes are used to make metaphors that explain the motives of a person who is sort of like you, but not really. </p><p> <b>4</b> "The people who come on <i>This American Life</i> have often never heard of our show, or have never even heard of NPR, so they have no idea what the conversation is going to be.

II<p></p> 1746<p></p> I<p></p> <br>The brig Henrietta having made Sandy Hook a little before the dinner hour&#x2014;and having passed the Narrows about three o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;and then crawling to and fro, in a series of tacks infinitesimal enough to rival the calculus, across the grey sheet of the harbour of New-York&#x2014;until it seemed to Mr. Smith, dancing from foot to foot upon deck, that the small mound of the city waiting there would hover ahead in the November gloom in perpetuity, never growing closer, to the smirk of Greek Zeno&#x2014;and the day being advanced to dusk by the time Henrietta at last lay anchored off Tietjes Slip, with the veritable gables of the city&#x2019;s veritable houses divided from him only by one hundred foot of water&#x2014;and the dusk moreover being as cold and damp and dim as November can afford, as if all the world were a quarto of grey paper dampened by drizzle until in danger of crumbling imminently to pap:&#x2014;all this being true, the master of the brig pressed upon him the virtue of sleeping this one further night aboard, and pursuing his shore business in the morning. (He meaning by the offer to signal his esteem, having found Mr. Smith a pleasant companion during the slow weeks of the crossing.) But Smith would not have it. Smith, bowing and smiling, desired nothing but to be rowed to the dock. Smith, indeed, when once he had his shoes flat on the cobbles, took off at such speed despite the gambolling of his land-legs that he far out-paced the sailor dispatched to carry his trunk&#x2014;and must double back for it, and seizing it hoist it instanter on his own shoulder&#x2014;and gallop on, skidding over fish-guts and turnip leaves and cats&#x2019; entrails, and the other effluvium of the port&#x2014;asking for direction here, asking again there&#x2014;so that he appeared most nearly as a type of smiling whirlwind when he shouldered open the door&#x2014;just as it was about to be bolted for the evening&#x2014;of the counting-house of the firm of Lovell &amp; Company, on Golden Hill Street, and laid down his burden while the prentices were lighting the lamps, and the clock on the wall showed one minute to five, and demanded, very civilly, speech that moment with Mr. Lovell himself.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Lovell,&#x201d; said the merchant, rising from his place by the fire. His qualities in brief, to meet the needs of a first encounter: fifty years old; a spare body but a pouched and lumpish face, as if Nature had set to work upon the clay with knuckles; shrewd and anxious eyes; brown small-clothes; a bob-wig yellowed by tobacco smoke. &#x201c;Help ye?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good day,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith, &#x201c;for I am certain it is a good day, never mind the rain and the wind. And the darkness. You&#x2019;ll forgive the dizziness of the traveller, sir. I have the honour to present a bill drawn upon you by your London correspondents, Messrs. Banyard and Hythe. And request the favour of its swift acceptance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Could it not have waited for the morrow?&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;Our hours for public business are over. Come back and replenish your purse at nine o&#x2019;clock. Though for any amount over ten pound sterling I&#x2019;ll ask you to wait out the week, cash money being scarce.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith. &#x201c;It is for a greater amount. A far greater. And I am come to you now, hot-foot from the cold sea, salt still on me, dirty as a dog fresh from a duck-pond, not for payment, but to do you the courtesy of long notice.&#x201d;<br> <br>And he handed across a portfolio, which being opened revealed a paper cover clearly sealed in black wax with a B and an H. Lovell cracked it, his eyebrows already half-raised. He read, and they rose further.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lord love us,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This is a bill for a thousand pound.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith. &#x201c;A thousand pounds sterling; or as it says there, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight pounds, fifteen shillings and fourpence, New-York money. May I sit down?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lovell ignored him. &#x201c;Jem,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;fetch a lantern closer.&#x201d;<br> <br>The clerk brought one of the fresh-lit candles in its chimney, and Lovell held the page up close to the hot glass; so close that Smith made a start as if to snatch it away, which Lovell reproved with an out-thrust arm; but he did not scorch the paper, only tilted it where the flame shone through and showed in paler lines the watermark of a mermaid.<br> <br>&#x201c;Paper&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said the clerk.<br> <br>&#x201c;The hand too,&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;Benjamin Banyard&#x2019;s own, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith, &#x201c;though his name was Barnaby Banyard when he sat in his office in Mincing Lane and wrote the bill for me. Come, now, gentlemen; do you think I found this on a street-corner?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lovell surveyed him, clothes and hands and visage and speech, such as he had heard of it, and found nothing there that closed the question.<br> <br>&#x201c;You might ha&#x2019; done,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;for all I know. For I don&#x2019;t know you. What is this thing? And who are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What it seems to be. What I seem to be. A paper worth a thousand pounds; and a traveller who owns it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or a paper fit to wipe my arse, and a lying rogue. Ye&#x2019;ll have to do better than that. I&#x2019;ve done business with Banyard&#x2019;s for twenty year, and settled with &#x2019;em for twenty year with bills on Kingston from my sugar traffic. Never this; never paper sent all on a sudden this side the water, asking money paid for the whole season&#x2019;s account, almost, without a word, or a warning, or a by-your-leave. I&#x2019;ll ask again: who are you? What&#x2019;s your business?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well: in general, Mr. Lovell, buying and selling. Going up and down in the world. Seeing what may turn to advantage; for which my thousand pounds may be requisite. But more specifically, Mr. Lovell: the kind I choose not to share. The confidential kind.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You impudent pup, flirting your mangled scripture at me! Speak plain, or your precious paper goes in the fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; said Smith.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, won&#x2019;t I? You jumped enough a moment gone when I had it nigh the lamp. Speak, or it burns.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And your good name with it. Mr. Lovell, this is the plain kernel of the matter: I asked at the Exchange for London merchants in good standing, joined to solid traders here, and your name rose up with Banyard&#x2019;s, as an honourable pair, and they wrote the bill.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They never did before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They have done now. And assured me you were good for it. Which I was glad to hear, for I paid cash down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cash down,&#x201d; repeated Lovell, flatly. He read out: &#x201c; &#x2018;At sixty days&#x2019; sight, pay this our second bill to Mr. Richard Smith, for value received&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x2019; You say you paid in coin, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of your own, or of another&#x2019;s? As agent, or principal? To settle a score or to write a new one? To lay out in investments, or to piss away on furbelows and sateen weskits?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just in coin, sir. Which spoke for itself, eloquently.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You not finding it convenient, no doubt, to move so great a weight of gold across the ocean.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or else hoping to find a booby on the other side as&#x2019;d turn paper to gold for the asking.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I never heard that New-Yorkers were so easy to impose on,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith.<br> <br>&#x201c;So we aren&#x2019;t, sir,&#x201d; said Lovell, &#x201c;so we aren&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He drummed his fingers. &#x201c;Especially when one won&#x2019;t take the straight way to clear off the suspicion we may be gulled. &#x2014;You&#x2019;ll excuse my manner. I speak as I find, usually; but I don&#x2019;t know how I find you, I don&#x2019;t know how to take you, and you study to keep me uncertain, which I don&#x2019;t see as a kindness, or as especial candid, I must say, in a strip of a boy who comes demanding payment of an awk&#x2019;ard-sized fortune, on no surety.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On all the ordinary surety of a right bill,&#x201d; protested Smith.<br> <br>&#x201c;There you go,&#x201d; Lovell said. &#x201c;Smiling again. Commerce is trust, sir. Commerce is need and need together, sir. Commerce is putting a hand in answer into a hand out-stretched; but when I call you a rogue, you don&#x2019;t flare up, as is the natural answer at the mere accusation, and call me a rogue for doubting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; returned Smith cheerfully. &#x201c;For you&#x2019;re right, of course. You don&#x2019;t know me; and suspicion must be your wisest course, when I may be equally a gilded sprig of the bon ton, or a flash cully working the inkhorn lay.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lovell blinked. Smith&#x2019;s voice had darkened to a rookery croak, and there was no telling if he was putting on or taking off a mask.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s the lovely power of being a stranger,&#x201d; Smith went on, as pleasant as before. &#x201c;I may as well have been born again when I stepped ashore. You&#x2019;ve a new man before you, new-made. I&#x2019;ve no history here, and no character: and what I am is all in what I will be. But the bill, sir, is a true one. How may I set your mind at rest?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve the oddest notion in the world of reassurance, if you&#x2019;re in earnest,&#x201d; said Lovell, staring. &#x201c;You could tell me why I&#x2019;ve had no letter, to cushion this surprise. I&#x2019;d have expected an explanation, a warning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps I out-paced it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps. But I believe I&#x2019;ll keep my counsel till I see more than perhaps.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith. &#x201c;Nothing more natural, when I may be a rascal.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Again, you make mighty free with that possibility,&#x201d; Lovell said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I only name the difficulty you&#x2019;re under. Would you trust me more if we pretended some other thing were at issue?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I might,&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;I might well. An honest man would surely labour to keep off the taint of such a thing. You seem to be inviting it, Mr. Smith. Yet I can&#x2019;t be so casual, can I? My name&#x2019;s my credit. Do you know what will happen if I accept your bill, for your secret business, your closed-mouth business, your smiling business, your confidential business? And you discount it with some good neighbour of mine, to lay your hands on the money as fast as may be, as I&#x2019;ve no doubt you mean to? Then there&#x2019;ll be sixty-day paper with my name upon&#x2019;t, going round and round the island, playing the devil with my credit just at the turn of the season, in no kind of confidence at all. All will know it; all will know I&#x2019;m to be dunned for a thousand pound, and wonder should they try to mulct me first.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But I won&#x2019;t discount it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t discount it. I can wait. There is no hurry. I have no pressing need for funds; sixty days&#x2019; sight, it says, and sixty days will suit me perfectly.

We&#x2019;ll wait and we&#x2019;ll see; and if the others of the set turn up, why then I&#x2019;ll say I accepted the bill today, and you shall have your sixty days, and if you&#x2019;re lucky you may be paid by quarter-day; and if they don&#x2019;t appear, why then you&#x2019;re the rascal you tease at being, and I&#x2019;ll have you before the justices for personation. What do you say?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s irregular,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith, &#x201c;but something should be allowed for teasing. Very well: done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Done,&#x201d; echoed Lovell. &#x201c;Jem, note and date the document, will you? And add a memorandum of this agreement; and make another note that we&#x2019;re to write to Banyard&#x2019;s on our own account, by the first vessel, asking explanations. And then let&#x2019;s have it in the strongbox, to show in evidence, as I suspect, for the assizes. Now, sir, I believe I&#x2019;ll bid you&#x2014;&#x201d; Lovell checked himself, for Smith was feeling through the pockets of his coat. &#x201c;Was there something else?&#x201d; he asked heavily.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Smith, bringing forth a purse. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m told I should break my guineas to smaller change. Could you furnish me the value of these in pieces convenient for the city?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lovell looked at the four golden heads of the King glittering in Smith&#x2019;s palm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are they brass?&#x201d; said one of the prentices, grinning.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, they&#x2019;re not brass,&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;Use your eyes, and not your mouth. Why ever&#x2014;?&#x201d; he said to Smith. &#x201c;Never mind. Never mind. Yes, I believe we can oblige you. Jem, get out the pennyweights, and check these.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Full weight,&#x201d; the clerk reported.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thought so,&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;I am learning your humours, Mr. Smith. Well, now, let&#x2019;s see. We don&#x2019;t get much London gold, the flow being, as you might say, all the other way; it&#x2019;s moidores, and half-joes, mostly, when the yellow lady shows her face. So I believe I could offer you a hundred and eighty per centum on face, in New-York money. Which, for four guineas, would come to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One hundred and fifty one shillings, twopence-halfpenny.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a calculator, are you? A sharp reckoner. Now I&#x2019;m afraid you can have only a little of it in coin; the reason being, as I said when first we began, that little coin is current at the present.&#x201d; Lovell opened a box with a key from his fob chain and dredged up silver&#x2014;worn silver, silver knocked and clatter&#x2019;d in the battles of circulation&#x2014;which he built into a little stack in front of Smith. &#x201c;A Mexica dollar, which we pass at eight-and-fourpence. A piece of four, half that. A couple of Portugee cruzeiros, three shillings New-York. A quarter-guilder. Two kreutzers, Lemberg. One kreutzer, Danish. Five sous. And a Moresco piece we can&#x2019;t read, but it weighs at fourteen pennyweight, sterling, so we&#x2019;ll call it two-and-six, New-York. Twenty-one and fourpence, total. Leaving a hundred and twenty-nine, tenpence-halfpenny to find in paper.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lovell accordingly began to count out a pile of creased and folded slips next to the silver, some printed black and some printed red and some brown, like the despoiled pages of a prayerbook, only of varying shapes and sizes; some limp and torn; some leathery with grease; some marked only with dirty letterpress and others bearing coats-of-arms, whales spouting, shooting stars, feathers, leaves, savages; all of which he laid down with the rapidity of a card-dealer, licking his fingers for the better passage of it all.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know our money, sir?&#x201d; said the clerk. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t tell you we use notes, specie being so scarce, this side?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Smith.<br> <br>The pile grew.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fourpence Connecticut, eightpence Rhode Island,&#x201d; murmured Lovell. &#x201c;Two shilling Rhode Island, eighteenpence Jersey, one shilling Jersey, eighteenpence Philadelphia, one shilling Maryland&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He had reached the bottom of the box. &#x201c;Excuse me, Mr. Smith; for the rest we&#x2019;re going to have to step upstairs to my bureau. We don&#x2019;t commonly have the call for so much at once. Jem, you can commence to close up; Isaiah, stop gawping, start sweeping. If you&#x2019;d like to follow me, then. &#x2014;Bring your winnings, by all means; we wouldn&#x2019;t want you to lose count.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see you mean to tease me back,&#x201d; said Mr. Smith, now possessed of a double handful of rustling, doubtful currency.<br> <br>&#x201c;One turn deserves another,&#x201d; said Lovell. &#x201c;This way.&#x201d;<br> <br>He led him through a door in the panelling, and Smith found himself in what was plainly the hall-way of the merchant&#x2019;s private residence, for it ran perpendicular to another street-door, whence fell the faint remaining light of the day; and where the counting office had smelled of ink, smoke, charcoal and t...</p><h2>The Gospel of John: Ignatius Catholic Study Bible, Revised Standard Version</h2><p>Based on the Revised Standard Version - Catholic Edition, this volume leads readers through a penetrating study of the Gospel of John, using the biblical text itself and the Church's own guidelines for understanding the Bible.

McPherson<br>Pultizer Prize-winning BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM<br>January 1864--General Robert E. Lee faces defeat. The Army of Northern Virginia is ragged and ill-equpped. Gettysburg has broken the back of the Confederacy and decimated its manpower.<br>Then, Andries Rhoodie, a strange man with an unplaceable accent, approaches Lee with an extraordinary offer. Rhoodie demonstrates an amazing rifle: Its rate of fire is incredible, its lethal efficiency breathtaking--and Rhoodie guarantees unlimited quantitites to the Confederates. <br>The name of the weapon is the AK-47....<br>Selected by the Science Fiction Book Club<br>A Main Selection of the Military Book Club<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>With the power and assurance of a master storyteller and the scrupulous accuracy of a trained historian, Harry Turtledove has created an immense, meticulously detailed, and utterly plausible world in which history takes a most unexpected turn. In The Guns of the South, Turtledove takes one of the most dramatic, bloody, and tumultuous episodes in our life as a nation, the Civil War, and vividly imagines what might have been had the rebels prevailed. In the unusually cold winter of 1864, General Robert E. Lee finds himself and his Army of Northern Virginia huddled on the banks of the Rapidan, trying to fight a war despite meager rations and a terrible lack of equipment - indeed, some of his men do not even have shoes. But when Lee finds a way to arm his forces, the tide suddenly turns; the rebels win a decisive victory at the Battle of Wilderness. Lee presses his advantage, marching on Washington. But if Lincoln surrenders, and the Confederacy can negotiate independence from the Union, there remain many obstacles to peace. The disputed states of Kentucky and Missouri must be accommodated. And the matter of slavery itself will threaten the newly independent Confederate States with fresh factional strife. Indeed, with victory come difficult choices for Robert E. Lee. War has worn down his health. His invalid wife lives for the day the two of them can finally build a peaceful life together. His days of service should be drawing to a close. Yet set against Lee&#39;s personal desires is the prospect of watching his beloved land squander the freedom that he and his men fought so desperately to win. Not for his own ambition but because duty calls, Lee will find himself faced with the price oftriumph. Mixing masterfully drawn historical and fictional characters, Turtledove brings to life the turmoil of a people in crisis. Here are the details of what it was like to fight in a Confederate army transformed from ragged to victorious: letters written home on scraps of wallpaper, &#34;coffee&#34; brewed from chicory and burnt grain, the fiery Battle of Wilderness, the march into Washington City and the confrontation with Lincoln, the negotiations between the United States and the Confederate States of America. Turtledove also takes us into conversations between General Lee and Confederate President Jefferson Davis and fascinating exchanges between Lee and Grant in their roles as keepers of the peace in a land divided. A highly original and extraordinary vision of history as it both was and could have been, The Guns of the South will take its place alongside the most exciting historical fiction ever written about the War Between the States.Harry Turtledove has taught at UCLA, California State Fullerton, and California State University, Los Angeles.</p><h2>The Crown Jewels: The British Secrets at the Heart of the KGB Archives</h2><p>This lively account of Soviet foreign intelligence activity in Great Britain during the Cold War is based on documents newly released from the KGB archives, their &#x201c;crown jewels,&#x201d; as the KGB unofficially called its most valuable assets. Written by Nigel West, called by the <i>Sunday Times &#x201c;</i>the unofficial historian of the secret services&#x201d; and Oleg Tsarev, a former KGB lieutenant colonel, <i>The Crown Jewels </i>provides<i> </i>much new information on the activities of all the well-known British pro-Soviet spies, including Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, and Anthony Blunt, as well as many lesser-known spymasters and recruiters, reproducing many of their reports for the first time.<br>The book adds unsuspected dimensions to the famous Cambridge ring (including details of Burgess&#x2019;s offer to murder his fellow conspirator Goronwy Rees). It also reveals a completely unknown Soviet network based in London and headed by a named <i>Daily Herald </i>journalist; describes the huge scale of Soviet penetration of the British Foreign Office from 1927 to 1951; explores a previously unknown spy ring in Oxford; and tells about the key role played by Blunt in supervising post-war Soviet espionage activities in London. <br><br></p><p>In the early 1920s, the newly founded Soviet Union established intelligence-gathering networks in several Western European capitals. Initially charged with spying on White Russians and other enemies of the Bolsheviks, these enclaves soon turned to collecting information on all kinds of political and economic activities in their host countries--and also to recruiting foreign nationals to serve the Soviet regime. The Soviets, write British historian Nigel West and retired Russian intelligence officer Oleg Tsarev, were especially successful in Britain, where they were able to make use of a band of disaffected university-based intellectuals who went into government service and who, in time, turned from coffeehouse revolutionaries to active traitors: John Cairncross, Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt, Donald Maclean, and, perhaps most infamous of them all, Kim Philby.<p> From the late 1930s to the 1950s, they operated a spy ring in England that gave to the Soviet Union secret information ranging from Allied troop strength in North Africa in World War II to British atomic-weapons development in the early years of the cold war. West and Tsarev reproduce numerous dispatches from these spies, contextualizing them in a detailed narrative that vividly describes the day-to-day hardships involved in forging a career in espionage. For instance, when the East German "atom spy" Klaus Fuchs had to reckon with postwar gas rationing as a factor in arranging rendezvous points with his agents, he had to confine them to London and close to the watchful British counterintelligence service. The story takes as many turns as a John Le Carr� thriller, and students of the cold war will find it of much interest. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>This is the most sensational volume to appear so far in Yale University Press's rapidly growing library on Soviet espionage. . . .

According to a companion adult volume, <i>Tim Burton's Nightmare before Christmas: The Film, the Art, the Vision</i>, reviewed in this issue's Upfront section, Burton has used an innovative stop-motion process to animate the movie. Maybe the story will work better as a movie than it does as a picture book. It stars Jack Skellington, Halloween's most famous figure. He concludes that Halloween's a drag, and after literally falling into Christmas Town, decides to shove Santa into a sack and trade places with him. This leads to such lines as "And what to their wondering eyes should appear / But a coffin sleigh with skeleton deer. / And a skeletal driver so ugly and sick / They knew in a moment, this can't be St. Nick." At least these lines scan better than some of the stanzas in the rhyming text. It's not clear who the audience for this is. The art is macabre and likely to scare little ones, especially those who still believe in Santa. Older kids may find the book amusing in a gross kind of way, but if they've seen the film, these illustrations aren't going to hold their interest. Libraries might want to consider purchase if the film's a holiday hit, but to be on the safe side, wait and see if the movie is big box office--and whether that translates into requests. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Tomie dePaola&#39;s Book of the Old Testament</h2><p>Presents retellings of twenty-one stories from the Old Testament, including Noah and his animal pairs on the ark, Jonah and the whale, and Moses and the burning bush</p><p></p><h2>Peril on Providence Island (Baker Family Adventures)</h2><p><p>The Bakers are full of excitement as they head to the English countryside to celebrate Grandfather Wilson's eightieth birthday.</p> <p>When an elderly neighbor with Alzheimer's disease tells a tale of treasure lost on the high seas, the Bakers are sure she has confused reality with fiction.

Their sculptural leaves and appealing textures make it difficult to stop at one, and it is easy to fill a garden with them. Help is at hand with this attractive guide to the popular new small hostas that take up less space and are ideally suited to container cultivation. They can be used on their own or with companion plants to make charming displays on the patio, porch, or even windowsill. </p><p> Many small hostas are simply scaled-down versions of classic hostas, while others offer distinctly new attributes in terms of color, leaf shape, and patterning. Like full-size hostas, small hostas can be upright, flat, or cascading; there are varieties that are full of substance, and others that are fine and delicate; there are green ones, gold ones, blue ones, variegated ones, and splashed ones. Some are better garden plants than others, and a valuable function of this book is to showcase the very best of the new introductions. Photographs of the hostas in garden settings show how admirably they respond to imaginative display in a wide range of situations including waterside, woodland, and rock gardens. </p><p> Beautifully illustrated and highly informative, this handpicked selection of diminutive hostas will inspire hobbyists and gardeners alike and provide inspiration for new planting schemes.</p></p><p><p>Kathy Guest Shadrack&nbsp;gardens passionately in Western New York.

Millions of people have asked these same questions, including Lee Strobel - an atheist who engaged in a thorough search for the truth to decide for himself if Jesus was who he claimed to be. Drawn from Lee's own experiences as a former atheist and featuring his journalistic style from his days as an investigative reporter with the Chicago Tribune, the notes and articles throughout The Case for Christ Study Bible are designed to motivate you to investigate the Bible's claims for yourself. Whether you are a Christian seeking encouragement in your faith and knowledge about who God is or a seeker or skeptic searching for answers, you will benefit from Lee's own extensive search for the truth.Some of the excellent study notes found in this Bible include:The Case for Christ ArticlesOver 220 The Case for Christ notes explore Jesus' claims and deity and demonstrate that he is the Messiah. The Case for the Bible NotesMore than 170 The Case for the Bible notes explore the character of the Bible and the extra-biblical evidence that corroborates Scripture as well as explain apparent contradictions within the Bible.The Case for a Creator NotesSeventy-five The Case for a Creator notes highlight the wonders of creation and demonstrate how the scientific evidence points to one all-powerful Creator.The Case for Faith ArticlesOne hundred The Case for Faith articles address questions such as, &#x201c;How can there be a God that would allow so much pain and suffering?&#x201d; and, &#x201c;Doesn't science prove that the world was created by chance?&#x201d;The Verdict NotesTwenty The Verdict notes provide testimonies from scholars and other Christians who have examined the evidence, discovered the reality of Jesus, and put their faith in him.

He and his family currently reside in Colorado.Chapter One <p></p><p></p>A bigail Foster stared through the windshield at the expired parking meter. Her fingers strangled the steering wheel, knuckles blanching, hands beginning to cramp. This had all seemed like such a good idea a month ago back in New York when she'd pitched the article to Margot, her editor at Great Outdoors. Now, on the verge of seeing him for the first time in twenty-six years, she realized she'd done herself the disservice of glossing over this moment and the fact that she'd have to walk into that building and face him. <p></p><p></p>Her watch showed five minutes to seven, which meant it was five to five, mountain time. She'd sat in this parking space for twenty minutes, and he was probably about to leave, thinking she'd decided not to come. <p></p><p></p>The hostess showed her toward the back of the brewpub, which at five in the afternoon stood mostly empty. Peanut shells littered the floor, crunching beneath the heels of her black pumps, and the reek of brewing beer infused the air with a yeasty sourness. The hostess held the back door open and motioned to the only occupied table on the patio. <p></p><p></p>Abigail stepped outside, smoothed the Cavalli skirt she'd paid way too much for last year in Milan. <p></p><p></p>The doubt resurfaced. She shouldn't have come. No story was worth this. <p></p><p></p>He sat alone with his back to her at a west-facing table, with the town of Durango, Colorado, spread out before him in its high valley, specked with the icy yellows of cottonwood and aspen, enclosed by pine-wooded hills and bare shale hills and, farther back, the spruce forests and jagged peaks of the San Juans. <p></p><p></p>The sound of the patio door banging shut caught his attention. He looked over his shoulder, and at the sight of her, slid his chair back from the table and stood&#x2014;tall, sturdy, wavy silver hair, dark blues, and dressed like something out of Backpacker magazine&#x2014;plaid Patagonia button-up shirt tucked into a comfortable pair of jeans, Livestrong bracelet, Teva sandals. <p></p><p></p>She felt that knot constricting in her stomach again, noticed his left hand trembling. He seized the chair he'd been sitting in to steady it. <p></p><p></p>"Hi, Lawrence." <p></p><p></p>She knew he was fifty-two, but he'd aged even better than his photo on the history department's Web site indicated. <p></p><p></p>No handshake, no hug, just five seconds of what Abigail ranked as the most excruciating eye contact she'd ever held. <p></p><p></p>Easing down into a chair, she counted three empty pints on the table, wished she'd had the benefit of alcohol to steel herself for this meeting. <p></p><p></p>She rifled through her purse, found her sunglasses. It was Halloween, and though the air carried a chill, at this elevation the intensity of direct sunlight made it pleasant to sit outdoors. <p></p><p></p>"I'm glad you came," Lawrence said. <p></p><p></p>A waiter costumed as a hula dancer approached the table. <p></p><p></p>"Want a beer, Abigail?" <p></p><p></p>"Sure." <p></p><p></p>"They have a bunch of different&#x2014;" <p></p><p></p>"I don't care. Something light." <p></p><p></p>He said to the waiter, "Bring her a Rock Hopped Pale." <p></p><p></p>"Right on." <p></p><p></p>The whistle of a steam-powered locomotive blew somewhere up the valley. Abigail saw the plume of smoke in the distance, heard the chugging palpitations of the valve gears as the train steamed south through the heart of town. <p></p><p></p>"I don't have any backpacking gear," she said. <p></p><p></p>"Scott will outfit you." <p></p><p></p>"Who's Scott?" <p></p><p></p>"Our guide." <p></p><p></p>The silence, uncomfortable as it came, crawled under her skin. <p></p><p></p>"Pretty town you have here." <p></p><p></p>She couldn't help thinking this didn't feel anything like she'd imagined it would. Having run countless versions of this moment through her head, they'd all carried more gravitas. She would scream at him. She'd hit him. They'd break down and cry together. He'd apologize. She'd accept. She wouldn't. Now she understood none of that would happen. They were just two people sharing a table, trying to limp through the awkwardness. <p></p><p></p>"I'm curious," she said. "All this time, and now you contact me." <p></p><p></p>"I've followed your journalism career, subscribe to all the magazines you regularly contribute to, and I thought this . . . expedition . . . might be good fodder for your&#x2014;" <p></p><p></p>"But you haven't been interested in helping me since I was four years old." <p></p><p></p>Lawrence slugged back the rest of his dark beer, stared at the mountains, wiped the foam from his beard. <p></p><p></p>Abigail said, "That came out more angry than&#x2014;" <p></p><p></p>"No, it's fine. You've got standing to be as angry as you want." <p></p><p></p>"I'm not, though." <p></p><p></p>The patio door opened and the waiter returned with Abigail's pint and another round for Lawrence. <p></p><p></p>When he'd left, she raised her glass. <p></p><p></p>"Lawrence," she said, "here's to our past. Fuck it." <p></p><p></p>He grinned. "That easy, huh?" <p></p><p></p>"We can pretend." <p></p><p></p>They clinked pints and Abigail sipped her golden beer. <p></p><p></p>"So why'd you come?" Lawrence asked. "To be honest, I never expected a response to that E-mail." <p></p><p></p>"Funny, I was just sitting out in the car, building the nerve to walk in here, and trying to answer that question for myself." <p></p><p></p>The sun ducked behind the mountains and Abigail shivered, the rocky slopes and snowfields blushing with alpenglow. <p></p><p></p>Excerpted from ABANDON by BLAKE CROUCHCopyright � 2009 by Blake CrouchPublished in July 2009 by St. Martin's Press <p></p><p></p>All rights reserved.

Just before dinner, according to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch, the world&#39;s only completely accurate book of prophecies written in 1655. The armies of Good and Evil are amassing and everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan. Except that a somewhat fussy angel and a fast-living demon are not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture. And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist. Put New York Times bestselling authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett together . . . and all Hell breaks loose.</p><p>Pratchett (of Discworld fame) and Gaiman (of Sandman fame) may seem an unlikely combination, but the topic (Armageddon) of this fast-paced novel is old hat to both. Pratchett&#39;s wackiness collaborates with Gaiman&#39;s morbid humor; the result is a humanist delight to be savored and reread again and again. You see, there was a bit of a mixup when the Antichrist was born, due in part to the machinations of Crowley, who did not so much fall as saunter downwards, and in part to the mysterious ways as manifested in the form of a part-time rare book dealer, an angel named Aziraphale. Like top agents everywhere, they&#39;ve long had more in common with each other than the sides they represent, or the conflict they are nominally engaged in. The only person who knows how it will all end is Agnes Nutter, a witch whose prophecies all come true, if one can only manage to decipher them. The minor characters along the way (Famine makes an appearance as diet crazes, no-calorie food and anorexia epidemics) are as much fun as the story as a whole, which adds up to one of those rare books which is enormous fun to read the first time, and the second time, and the third time...<p>According to <em>The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter</em>, <em>Witch</em> (the world's only <em>completely</em> accurate book of prophecies, written in 1655, before she exploded), the world will end on a Saturday.

There are also forts of every description, including a 21-foot-tall lookout tower modeled on one George Washington built to keep an eye on the redcoats. <br><br>Stiles also adds a design for a snowball catapult, an igloo and even a Nerf-loaded cannon. <br><br>Written for children, with an adult peeking over their shoulder, Stiles's TREEHOUSES, HUTS, &amp; FORTS is a dreamer's handbook, offering practical results. <br></p><p>This book is filled with fun projects for kids and their parents to build in their backyards.

From verbalizing&nbsp;&nbsp;chimpanzees to scientific speculations involving&nbsp;&nbsp;machines with souls, from the mesmerizing, maze-like&nbsp;&nbsp;fiction of Borges to the tantalizing, dreamlike&nbsp;&nbsp;fiction of Lem and Princess Ineffable, her circuits&nbsp;&nbsp;glowing read and gold, <i>The Mind's I </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;opens the mind to the Black Box of fantasy, to the&nbsp;&nbsp;windfalls of reflection, to new dimensions of&nbsp;&nbsp;exciting possibilities.</p><p>Ever wondered who you are? Who you <i>really</i> are? This collection of writings and reflections by some of today's most notable thinkers is designed to enliven this most central, and most baffling, question in the philosophy of mind. In some ways, the questions posed and bantered about in this book are at the heart of all philosophical reasoning. They are the ultimate questions about the self. <i>The Mind's I</i> contains an astonishing variety of approaches to answering the question, "Who am I?" Between the covers of this book one encounters the literary erudition of Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges alongside the analytic rigor of John Searle. There are sophisticated metaphorical pieces (such as "The Princess Ineffabelle" by Polish philosopher and writer Stanislaw Lem), intriguing dialogues (like Raymond Smullyan's "Is God a Taoist?"), and serious but engaging philosophical essays from a host of thinkers (see Thomas Nagel's "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"). <p> Editors Hofstadter and Dennett--leading lights in the study of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of mind--follow each selection with a short reflection designed to elaborate on their main themes. <i>The Mind's I</i> admirably broadens their fields to a more general audience. The book's essays are grouped into six categories, each successively raising the philosophical stakes by introducing new levels of complexity. Ultimately, one confronts some of the thorniest questions in modern philosophy here, such as the nature of free will, our place in the metaphysical world, and the possibility of genuine artificial intelligence. The book closes with a playful and perplexing piece by Robert Nozick, an adequate summation to <i>The Mind's I</i>. He writes, "Perhaps God has not decided yet whether he has created, in this world, a fictional world or a real one.... Which decision do you hope for?" <i>--Eric de Place</i></p>"Ever since David Hume declared in the 18th century that the Self is only a heap of perceptions, the poor Ego has been in a shaky conditions indeed...Mind and consciousness becomes dispensable items in our accounts of reality, ghosts in the bodily machine...Yet there are indications here and there that the tide may be tuming...and the appearance of <i>The Mind's I</i>, edited by Douglas R. Hofstadter and Daniel C. Dennett, seems a welcome sign of change."--William Barrett, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>To the Break of Dawn: A Freestyle on the Hip-Hop Aesthetic</h2><p><p><strong>2007 Arts Club of Washington&#x2019;s National Award for Arts Writing - Finalist</strong></p><p><strong>SEE ALSO: <em>Pimps Up, Ho&#x2019;s Down: Hip Hop&#x2019;s Hold on Young Black Women</em> by T.

A kid from Queens who spent his youth at the epicenter of this new art form, music critic William Jelani Cobb takes readers inside the beats, the lyrics, and the flow of hip-hop, separating mere corporate rappers from the creative MCs that forged the art in the crucible of the street jam.</p><p>The four pillars of hip hop&#x2014;break dancing, graffiti art, deejaying, and rapping&#x2014;find their origins in traditions as diverse as the Afro-Brazilian martial art Capoeira and Caribbean immigrants&#x2019; turnstile artistry. Tracing hip-hop&#x2019;s relationship to ancestral forms of expression, Cobb explores the cultural and literary elements that are at its core. From KRS-One and Notorious B.I.G. to Tupac Shakur and Lauryn Hill, he profiles MCs who were pivotal to the rise of the genre, verbal artists whose lineage runs back to the black preacher and the bluesman.</p><p>Unlike books that focus on hip-hop as a social movement or a commercial phenomenon, <strong>To the Break of Dawn</strong> tracks the music's aesthetic, stylistic, and thematic evolution from its inception to today's distinctly regional sub-divisions and styles.

Cobb&#x2019;s writing style is engaging, and the book benefits from the legitimacy provided by the author&#x2019;s background: he is a former MC who grew up with the culture.&#x201d;<br>-<i>Choice</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;At a time when academics are just beginning to recognize hip hop as a legitimate form, William Jelani Cobb, a child of rap himself, brings an unparalleled level of understanding to the music. His historically informed yet hip-to-the-tip viewpoint roots readers in the art form rather than the hype.&#x201d;<br>-Chuck D</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;What makes William Jelani Cobb&#x2019;s <em>To the Break of Dawn</em> so refreshing is that it centers on what hip-hop is, rather than on what it does. Eschewing the common practice of treating rap lyrics as just another way to talk about race, politics or the self, Cobb treats them as art. His aim is ambitious: to articulate hip-hop's aesthetic principles while tracing its roots back to the &#x2018;ancestral poetic and musical traditions&#x2019; of black oral culture, from Sunday sermons to gut-bucket blues. <em>To the Break of Dawn</em> celebrates lyrical invention, the artists and even the particular rhymes that make hip-hop great. For the uninitiated, it is Hip-Hop 101, offering a rich overview of rap's verbal artistry. For the aficionado, it alternately affirms and challenges deeply held beliefs of what is valuable in hip-hop.&#x201d;<br> </p>-<i>Washington Post Book World</i><p></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Cobb has contributed a worthy study to the growing literature on hip-hop.&#x201d;<br>-<i>Popular Music</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Finally, a hip hop study that captures the verve and swagger that marked the work of our critical forebears Albert Murray and Amiri Baraka. In his brilliant new tome, William Jelani Cobb bridges the gap between the majesty of the blues and the gully regality of hip hop.&#x201d;<br>-Mark Anthony Neal,author of <i>New Black Man</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Wow! <em>To the Break of Dawn</em> is a crucial contribution to hip hop history. I'm thrilled that William Jelani Cobb has documented hip hop's relationship to the blues. If you want to truly understand how hip hop was born, read this book.&#x201d;<br> </p>-MC Lyte<br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>To the Break of Dawn</em> is smart, funny, conversational&#x2014;a book to touch off serious study of the modern MC.&#x201d;<br> </p>-<i>The Austin Chronicle</i><p></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>To the Break of Dawn</em> marks a crucial turning point in hip-hop writing. . . . By opening the discourse on hip-hop&#x2019;s aesthetic, Cobb spearheads a new sub-genre, and perhaps a return or revolution in hip-hop aesthetics.&#x201d;<br> </p>-<i>Black Issues Book Review</i></p><h2>King Bidgood&#39;s in the Bathtub</h2><p>The Knight, the Duke, the Queen--and eventually the whole court--all try to lure King Bidgood from his cozy bathtub, but he won&#39;t get out!

A year later, newspaper headlines declared "Gold Fever!" as hundreds of thousands of men and women borrowed money, quit their jobs, and allowed themselves- for the first time ever-to imagine a future of ease and splendor. In THE RUSH, Edward Dolnick brilliantly recounts their treacherous westward journeys by wagon and on foot, and takes us to the frenzied gold fields and the rowdy cities that sprang from nothing to jam-packed chaos. With an enthralling cast of characters and scenes of unimaginable wealth and desperate ruin, THE RUSH is a fascinating-and rollicking-account of the greatest treasure hunt the world has ever seen.</p><p>Edward Dolnick is the author of <i>The Forger's Spell</i>, <i>Down the Great Unknown</i> and the Edgar Award-winning <i>The Rescue Artist</i>.

And in doing so Dolnick plumbs the nature of fraud itself...an incomparable page turner."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Boston Globe</em></i></b><br><br>"[Dolnick] tells his story engagingly and with a light touch.

Spider-Man, the X-Men, Nick Fury, Dr. Strange, Daredevil, Dr. Doom, Black Widow, Captain America, and more appear in the waning days of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. As the world begins to change and enter into a new age, Gaiman weaves a thrilling mystery. How and why are these Marvel stars appearing nearly 400 years before they&#39;re supposed to? Collects Marvel 1602 #1-8.</p><p>Starred Review. The always inventive Gaiman has concocted an unlikely&#x2014;but fantastically successful&#x2014;superhero comic that transfers Marvel's classic characters to the Elizabethan period. Nick Fury is still a lethal government operative, but now he's an adviser to Queen Elizabeth. Her Majesty is equally reliant on magician and doctor Stephen Strange. X-Men mentor Charles Xavier still shepherds a band of mutant teens, only now he's called Carlos Javier, and the mutants are known, and mistrusted, as "witchbreed." Carlos's mysterious nemesis has taken on a new job: grand inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition. Peter Parker (here "Parquah") is still a confused but well-meaning teenager who has yet to be bitten by a radioactive spider. Placed in a period landscape (rendered in rich, painterly panels by illustrator Kubert and digital painter Richard Isanove), these familiar characters must grapple with the issues of the day, chief among them the machinations of the evil King James of Scotland. And, in classic superhero style, they must save the world. The improbable combination works remarkably well, as the superheroes' strange abilities adapt to Elizabethan culture. This glorious adventure is peppered with Scott McKowen's gorgeous, moody cover-art woodcuts. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now Nick Bantock gives a short course in visual creativity in <i>Urgent 2nd Class</i>. A tour through the techniques and materials which constitute his signature style, Bantock shares with readers numerous ways ways of using old paper ephemera -- maps, letters, postcards, ledgers, scraps, photos, and many more items -- to create their own idiosyncratic art. Written for people of all artistic skill levels, the materials mentioned are all easily found and inexpensive, and the processes are simple enough to do at home (and with access to the most advanced machinery used in the book, a photocopier).

Bantock, whose six <i>Griffin &amp; Sabine</i> books imagine an epistolary love and include the "actual" letters and cards it is conducted through, offers a plethora of techniques for bringing past and present together by collecting aging paper, and transforming its original communicative use or transactional value through one's own choices in juxtaposition, placement and additive drawing. He offers beautiful, full-color examples of his own work in short chapters devoted to the various pulp forms above, with five or six paragraphs explaining what he likes or how he uses each (on family photos: "I'm not overly interested in battling internally with where sentimentality ends and nostalgia begins&#x2014;so I steer clear all together"), followed by examples of works he's done with short captions. The printing and layout are as lush as <i>Griffin &amp; Sabine</i> fans would expect, and Bantock offers a judicious mix of his own practice and advice for one's own. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

So when someone calls me in the middle of the night, they&#x2019;d better be dying.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Mercy,&#x201d; said Stefan&#x2019;s amiable voice in my ear. &#x201c;I wonder if you could do me a favor.&#x201d;</p><p>Stefan had done his dying a long time ago, so I saw no reason to be nice. &#x201c;I answered the phone at&#x201d;&#x2014;I peered blearily at the red numbers on my bedside clock&#x2014;&#x201c;three o&#x2019;clock in the morning.&#x201d;</p><p>Okay, that&#x2019;s not exactly what I said. I may have added a few of those words a mechanic picks up to use at recalcitrant bolts and alternators that land on her toes.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose you could go for a second favor,&#x201d; I continued, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;d prefer you hang up and call me back at a more civilized hour.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed. Maybe he thought I was trying to be funny. &#x201c;I have a job to do, and I believe your particular talents would be a great asset in assuring the success of the venture.&#x201d;</p><p>Old creatures, at least in my experience, like to be a little vague when they&#x2019;re asking you to do something. I&#x2019;m a businesswoman, and I believe in getting to the specifics as quickly as possible.</p><p>&#x201c;At three in the morning you need a mechanic?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a vampire, Mercedes,&#x201d; he said gently. &#x201c;Three in the morning is still prime time. But I don&#x2019;t need a mechanic, I need you. You owe me a favor.&#x201d;</p><p>He was right, darn him. He&#x2019;d helped me when the local Alpha werewolf&#x2019;s daughter was kidnapped. He had warned me that he&#x2019;d be collecting in return.</p><p>I yawned and sat up, giving up all hope of going back to sleep. &#x201c;All right. What am I doing for you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to be delivering a message to a vampire who is here without my mistress&#x2019;s permission,&#x201d; he said, getting to the point. &#x201c;I need a witness he won&#x2019;t notice.&#x201d;</p><p>He hung up without getting an answer, or even telling me when he was coming to pick me up. It would serve him right if I just went back to sleep.</p><p>Muttering to myself, I threw on clothing: jeans, yesterday&#x2019;s T-shirt complete with mustard stain, and two socks with only one hole between them. Once I was more or less dressed, I shuffled off to the kitchen and poured myself a glass of cranberry juice.</p><p>It was a full moon, and my roommate, the werewolf, was out running with the local pack, so I didn&#x2019;t have to explain to him why I was going out with Stefan. Which was just as well.</p><p>Samuel wasn&#x2019;t a bad roommate as such things go, but he had a tendency to get possessive and dictatorial. Not that I let him get away with it, but arguing with werewolves requires a certain subtlety I was lacking at&#x2014;I checked my wristwatch&#x2014;3:15 in the morning.</p><p>For all that I was raised by them, I&#x2019;m not a werewolf, not a were-anything. I&#x2019;m not a servant of the moon&#x2019;s phases, and in the coyote shape that is my second form, I look like any other canis latrans: I have the buckshot scars on my backside to prove it.</p><p>Werewolves cannot be mistaken for wolves: weres are much bigger than their non-preternatural counterparts&#x2014;and a lot scarier.</p><p>What I am is a walker, though I&#x2019;m sure there once was another name for it&#x2014;an Indian name lost when the Europeans devoured the New World. Maybe my father could have told me what it was if he hadn&#x2019;t died in a car wreck before he knew my mother was pregnant. So all I know is what the werewolves could tell me, which wasn&#x2019;t much.</p><p>The &#x201c;walker&#x201d; comes from the Skinwalkers of the Southwest Indian tribes, but I have less in common with a Skin-walker, at least from what I&#x2019;ve read, than I do with the werewolves. I don&#x2019;t do magic, I don&#x2019;t need a coyote skin to change shape&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m not evil.</p><p>I sipped my juice and looked out of the kitchen window. I couldn&#x2019;t see the moon herself, just her silver light that touched the nighttime landscape. Thoughts of evil seemed somehow appropriate while I waited for the vampire to come for me. If nothing else, it would keep me from falling asleep: fear has that effect on me. I&#x2019;m afraid of evil.</p><p>In our modern world, even the word seems...old fashioned. When it comes out of hiding briefly in a Charles Manson or a Jeffrey Dahmer, we try to explain it away with drug abuse, an unhappy childhood, or mental illness.</p><p>Americans in particular are oddly innocent in their faith that science holds explanations for everything. When the werewolves finally admitted what they were to the public several months ago, the scientists immediately started looking for a virus or bacteria that could cause the Change&#x2014;magic being something their laboratories and computers can&#x2019;t explain. Last I&#x2019;d heard Johns Hopkins had a whole team devoted to the issue. Doubtless they&#x2019;d find something, too, but I&#x2019;m betting they&#x2019;ll never be able to explain how a 180-pound man turns into a 250-pound werewolf. Science doesn&#x2019;t allow for magic any more than it allows for evil.</p><p>The devout belief that the world is explainable is both a terrible vulnerability and a stout shield. Evil prefers it when people don&#x2019;t believe. Vampires, as a not-random example, seldom go out and kill people in the street. When they go hunting, they find someone who won&#x2019;t be missed and bring them home where they are tended and kept comfortable&#x2014;like a cow in a feedlot.</p><p>Under the rule of science, there are no witch burnings allowed, no water trials or public lynchings. In return, the average law-abiding, solid, citizen has little to worry about from the things that go bump in the night. Sometimes I wish I were an average citizen.</p><p>Average citizens don&#x2019;t get visited by vampires.</p><p>Nor do they worry about a pack of werewolves&#x2014;at least not quite the same way as I was.</p><p>Coming out in public was a bold step for the werewolves; one that could easily backfire. Staring out at the moonlit night, I fretted about what would happen if people began to be afraid again. Werewolves aren&#x2019;t evil, but they aren&#x2019;t exactly the peaceful, law-abiding heroes that they&#x2019;re trying to represent themselves as either.</p><p>Someone tapped on my front door.</p><p>Vampires are evil. I knew that&#x2014;but Stefan was more than just a vampire. Sometimes I was pretty sure he was my friend. So I wasn&#x2019;t really afraid until I opened the door and saw what waited on my porch.</p><p>The vampire&#x2019;s dark hair was slicked back, leaving his skin very pale in the moon&#x2019;s light. Dressed in black from head to heels, he ought to have looked like a refugee from a bad Dracula movie, but somehow the whole outfit, from black leather duster to silk gloves, looked more authentic on Stefan than his usual bright-colored T-shirt and grubby jeans. As if he&#x2019;d removed a costume, rather than put one on.</p><p>He looked like someone who could kill as easily as I could change a tire, with as little thought or remorse.</p><p>Then his mobile brows climbed his forehead&#x2014;and he was suddenly the same vampire who&#x2019;d painted his old VW bus to look like Scooby&#x2019;s Mystery Machine.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look happy to see me,&#x201d; he said with a quick grin that didn&#x2019;t show his fangs. In the dark, his eyes looked more black than brown&#x2014;but then so did mine.</p><p>&#x201c;Come in.&#x201d; I backed away from the door so he could; then, because he&#x2019;d scared me I added snappishly, &#x201c;If you want welcoming, try stopping by at a decent hour.&#x201d;</p><p>He hesitated on the threshold, smiled at me, and said, &#x201c;By your invitation.&#x201d; Then he stepped inside my house.</p><p>&#x201c;That threshold thing really works?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>His smile widened again, this time I saw a glint of white. &#x201c;Not after you&#x2019;ve invited me in.&#x201d;</p><p>He walked past me and into the living room and then turned like a model on a runway. The folds of his duster spread out with his turn in an effect nearly cape-like.</p><p>&#x201c;So how do you like me a la Nosferatu?&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed and admitted it. &#x201c;Scared me. I thought you eschewed all things gothic.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d seldom seen him in anything other than jeans and T-shirts.</p><p>His smile widened even more. &#x201c;Usually I do. But the Dracula look does have its place. Oddly enough, used sparingly, it scares other vampires almost as well as it does the odd coyote-girl. Don&#x2019;t worry, I have a bit of costuming for you, too.&#x201d;</p><p>He reached under his coat and pulled out a silver-studded leather harness.</p><p>I stared at it a moment. &#x201c;Going to an S&amp;M strip club are you? I didn&#x2019;t realize there was anything like that around here.&#x201d; There wasn&#x2019;t, not to my knowledge. Eastern Washington is more prudish than Seattle or Portland.</p><p>He laughed. &#x201c;Not tonight, sweetheart. This is for your other self.&#x201d; He shook the straps out so I could see that it was a dog harness.</p><p>I took it from him. It was good leather, soft and flexible with so much silver that it looked like jewelry. If I&#x2019;d been strictly human, no doubt I&#x2019;d have been taken aback at wearing such a thing. But when you spend a good part of your time running around as a coyote, collars and the like are pretty useful.</p><p>The Marrok, the leader of the North American werewolves, insists that all of the wolves wear a collar when they run in the cities, with tags that identify them as someone&#x2019;s pet. He also insists the names on the tags be something innocuous like Fred or Spot, no Killers or Fangs. It&#x2019;s safer that way&#x2014;both for the werew...</p></p><h2>The Miracle of Water</h2><p><b>Masaru Emoto</b> has photographed thousands of water crystals throughout his years of research, yet few have been as beautiful and life affirming as those formed from the words "love and gratitude." In <i>The Miracle of Water</i>, Dr. Emoto demonstrates how water's unique role in transporting the natural vibration of these words can help you welcome change and live a more positive and happy life. Dr. Emoto also explores the significance of words and language, their origins, and their impact on water. He introduces and explains the key concept of resonance -- the vehicle through which life-force energy is transmitted. From this knowledge, he draws out lessons that we can apply to our lives to reap the benefits of positive resonance, including more harmonious relationships, restored health, and improved communications. This thoughtful book includes new and extraordinary water-crystal photographs that provide convincing reasons for all of us to choose positive words and strive for perfect resonance for a more healthy, peaceful, and happy life.</p><p><b>Masaru Emoto</b> is an internationally renowned Japanese researcher who has gained worldwide acclaim.

And the truth is often more remarkable than fiction.</strong></p><p>MI6 has been cloaked in secrecy and shrouded in myth since it was created a hundred years ago. Our understanding of what it is to be a spy has been largely defined by the fictional worlds of Ian Fleming and John le Carr�. Gordon Corera provides a unique and unprecedented insight into this secret world and the reality that lies behind the fiction. He tells the story of how the secret service has changed since the end of the Second World War and, by focusing on the people and the relationships that lie at the heart of espionage, illustrates the danger, the drama, the intrigue, and the moral ambiguities that come with working for British intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>From the defining period of the early Cold War through to the modern day, MI6 has undergone a dramatic transformation from a gung-ho, amateurish organisation to its modern, no less controversial, incarnation. Gordon Corera reveals the triumphs and disasters along the way. The grand dramas of the Cold War, the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the Iraq War are the backdrop for the individual spies whose stories form the centrepiece of the narrative. And some of the individuals featured here, in turn, helped shape the course of those events. Corera draws on the first-hand accounts of those who have spied, lied, and in some cases nearly died in service of the state. They range from the spymasters to the agents they controlled to their sworn enemies. And the truth is often more remarkable than the fiction.</p></p><p>Gordon Corera is a Security Correspondent for BBC News. He has presented major documentaries for the BBC on cybersecurity, including Crypto Wars&nbsp;and Under Attack: Espionage, Sabotage, Subversin and Warfare in the Cyber Age. He is the author of The Art of Betrayal. He lives in London.&#x201c;His analysis is shrewd, his judgement sound...(the book's) strength is to present stories of the secret service's successes and failures within the political and strategic context of the times.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Sunday Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Easily the most pervasive and dangerous of all the modern conspiracy theories is the one claiming that President&nbsp;George W. Bush&nbsp;and British Prime Minister Tony Blair knew that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before nevertheless deciding to invade in 2003. No other misrepresentation in recent times has so damaged the trust between government and the governed. How gratifying, therefore, that as authoritative and respected a commentator as Gordon Corera explodes that myth completely in "The Art of Betrayal," a wide-ranging, thought-provoking and highly readable history of Britain's postwar Secret Intelligence Service, popularly known as MI6.....This well-written, hard-hitting book&#x2015;full of, as one footnotes states, "private information from an individual who, unsurprisingly, requested anonymity"&#x2015;shows that MI6 has never in the past put its own conscience before its duty to protect the public. It mustn't start now.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrew Roberts, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Corera, the BBC's security correspondent, has enjoyed privileged access to key spy players from the past few decades and, writing in an engaging style, he picks up the story of the MI6 at the point where the "official" history grinds to a halt after the Second World War.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Sunday Express</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As a good journalist and a reader of spy novels, Corera presents his material as fast-paced stories, from the covert diplomacy of the Cold War to recent and current security concerns in Afghanistan and the Middle East, and he humanizes the grand dramas of a duplicitous trade.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Times (London)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Highly readable and well-researched account of the Service...Let's hope the current generation of spooks has learnt from past mistakes.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Daily Telegraph</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A superb new history of British intelligence.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Evening Standard</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The best post-1949 account of British intelligence I have read. This is as good as it gets.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alan Judd, <em>The Spectator</em></strong></p><h2>Integrative Theology</h2><p><p>Integrative Theology is designed to help graduate students in a pluralistic world utilize a standard method of fruitful research. Each chapter on a major doctrine: (1) states a classic issue of ultimate concern, (2) surveys alternative past and present answers and (3) tests those proposals by their congruence with information on the subject progressively revealed from Genesis to Revelation. Then the chapter (4) formulates a doctrinal conclusion that consistently fits the many lines of biblical data, (5) defends that conviction respectfully, and finally (6) explores the conclusion&#x2019;s relevance to a person&#x2019;s spiritual birth, growth and service to others, all for the glory of God. Why the title Integrative Theology? In each chapter, steps 2-6 integrate the disciplines of historical, biblical, systematic, apologetic and practical theology.</p></p><p>Gordon R.

Space with no bounds? And what about Armageddon, The Lake of Fire, The Mark of the Beast?</p><p>Am I supposed to feel good about all this?</p><p>If these words could be yours, you aren't alone. There is much about the end of history we don't understand. But while thoughts on the final day will stir our questions, they needn't stir our fears.

Lucado's primary concern is not theological but practical: how should we respond? And what should we do in the meantime? His answer is clear, if paradoxical: "wait forwardly," he writes. Be "patiently vigilant." Live in expectation even as you live fully in the present. <p> Lucado's strength lies in his ability to stay close to his own story, which includes a life-changing realization of God's mercy, and in his ability to stay connected to his Church of Christ congregation and his readers. He keeps these parishioners clearly in mind as he preaches and as he converts his sermons into bestselling books. Designed to be read in about 10 minutes, each chapter emphasizes mercy and pardon rather than judgment and suggests, as the book's subtitle affirms, that Christ's return is "the beginning of all good things." </p><p> Those looking for theological explorations or complex eschatology are advised to look elsewhere. For thousands of the evangelical faithful, however, Lucado is the Billy Graham of the '90s. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p><p>With more than 130 million products in print, Max Lucado is America's bestselling inspirational author.

Sadly, many believers have never experienced true intimacy with God because they don't understand what it is or how to achieve it. But we humans were created for intimate fellowship with God, and this has always been His deepest desire. Scripture clearly states that the Lord yearns for us and seeks those who pursue Him. Yet we must come to Jesus on His terms-not our own. </p><p>In <em>Drawing Near</em>, John Bevere invites readers to explore a life of intimacy with God. Emphasizing the need for obedience, he urges us to practice-just as we would practice anything we hope to improve-our communication with the Holy Spirit. Understanding that prayer is a dialogue, not a monologue, Bevere encourages us to listen at the Father's feet. Study questions in each chapter offer opportunity for reflection, and a "How to draw near to God" section offers practical steps toward developing true intimacy with Him.</p></p><p><b>John Bevere</b> is a best-selling author and popular conference speaker.

God, writes Bevere, longs to have intimate communion with each of his children and has taken great pains throughout history to establish relationships with individual people. Drawing upon numerous biblical stories, many of which are relatively obscure tales from the Old Testament, Bevere displays a rare talent for detailed scrutiny of the text. Readers will be startled by some of his fresh, perceptive observations about various biblical passages, or the attention he gives to certain glossed-over details.

Featuring four distinct but inter-connected dimensions, the C3 Inquiry Arc lays out a process for supporting students to ask questions about our social world, use concepts and tools from the disciplines that make up social studies, analyze and argue about what they have learned, and apply that knowledge to the challenges that face our world today. While the C3 Framework was an important step in clarifying what inquiry should ideally look like in social studies, teachers understandably wanted more. Teachers have rightfully wondered: How do I teach the Civil War or the Civil Rights Movement or the Gilded Age through inquiry? How do the four dimensions apply to wealth inequality or teaching the three branches of government or push and pull patterns of immigration? We wrote this design book wanting to understand, how do you really (we mean, really) write an inquiry? Where do you start and how do you finish? What ideas come in-between? How do we teach others to do the IDM without falling down the rabbit hole of making things too complex, too convoluted, or too esoteric? Could we be as clear about a process for developing an IDM as we were in defining the C3 Inquiry Arc? As methods instructors, we couldn&#39;t help but tackle this challenge and this book is the product of a 4-year conversation (and on some days, argument) about how exactly we do IDM.</p><p></p><h2>Grow With Your Plants: The Mother Earth Hassle-Free Way</h2><p>Lynn and Joel Rapp, Ms. and Mr. Mother Earth, the authors of bestselling Mother Earth&#39;s Hassle-Free Indoor Plant Book, once again have turned their experiences with little green things into an amusing and instructive book.

The lives of three extraordinary men are bound together by the tides of history in this sweeping tale that includes remarkable historical figures such as Oscar Wilde and Disraeli.</p><p>Eagerly awaited by readers of The Year of the French, Flanagan's new novel is even more powerful and engrossing than its predecessor. Set during three pivotal decades of Irish history, the narrative focuses on four men who participate in the short-lived Rising of 1867 and the irrevocable effects on their lives of the battle of Clonbrony Wood. Ned Nolan returns from America to his hometown of Kilpeder to lead the uprising, programmed by the Irish Republican Brotherhoodthe Fenianswhose sacred oath is the motivating obsession of Ned's existence. He enlists the aid of three of Kilpeder's young men: schoolmaster Hugh MacMahon, Robert Delaney, a bright, ambitious shopkeeper's assistant, and Vincent Tully, charming wastrel son of the town's leading merchant. In the aftermath of the aborted rebellion, Ned hardens into a merciless terrorist. Bob becomes a solicitor, an MP in the party of Charles Stewart Parnell and the lover of the wife of the Earl of Ardmor, who "owns" Kilpeder and lives in an estate overlooking the town. Except for Hugh, who is one of the narrators of this moving story, tragedy stalks each of the veterans of Clonbrony Wood. Their intertwined life dramas are played out against the tragedy of Ireland's bloody attempts to shake the yoke of British rule. The novel beautifully integrates the lives of its fictional characters with a striking depiction of the historical circumstances that motivated rebellion against the Crown. Flanagan's portrayal of the texture of Irish society illuminates the roots of perennial conflict. He skillfully describes the rise of Charles Parnell and the success of the Land League campaign, Parnell's disgrace and the destruction of all his accomplishments while the "damned bloody empire . . . settled back to watch the Irish tear ourselves to pieces." As in all tragedy, there is irony: of Irish informers betraying their compatriots; of Parnell's sudden fall just as home rule seems certain; of the way Bob Delaney's life mirrors that of his leader's. Written in musical prose and imbued with an elegiac strain, the novel also eulogizes the innocence, hope and idealism of youth, which, because "we are all the tenants of Time," gives way to the disillusionment and bitter accommodations of one's maturer years. A fine fusion of solid historical and sociological insight with a shrewd, sensitive grasp of character, plus a steady sweep of dramatic momentum incorporating an affecting portrait of a doomed love affair, this is a book one does not want to put down. It is a significant literary achievement, as timely as today's headlines about violence in Ireland. 100,000 first printing; $100,000 ad/promo; BOMC featured alternate. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Flanagan's The Year of the French was a popular, award-winning, and masterful account of the Irish uprising of 1798. This novel deals with the years between the failed Fenian uprising of 1867 and the death of Parnell late in 1891. Parnell and the Land League agitation of the 1880s had a revolutionary effect upon Irish history. Flanagan vividly shows how the personal histories of his many characters both created and were changed by the history of their times. The nature and meaning of history is one of the themes of this book, as is the way history is remembered and recorded. Flanagan has the mind of a philosophical historian, but also the talent of a gifted storyteller. A model of historical fiction.

The American Constitution is different. Compared to Europe and the ancient world, America was a society of almost unprecedented economic equality, and the founding generation saw this equality as essential for the preservation of America&#x2019;s republic. Over the next two centuries, generations of Americans fought to sustain the economic preconditions for our constitutional system. But today, with economic and political inequality on the rise, Sitaraman says Americans face a choice: Will we accept rising economic inequality and risk oligarchy or will we rebuild the middle class and reclaim our republic? <br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Crisis of the Middle-Class Constitution</i> is a tour de force of history, philosophy, law, and politics. It makes a compelling case that inequality is more than just a moral or economic problem; it threatens the very core of our constitutional system.</p><p><b>GANESH SITARAMAN </b>is Professor of Law at Vanderbilt Law School and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. He has been a longtime advisor to Senator Elizabeth Warren, serving as her policy director and senior counsel. Sitaraman has commented on foreign and domestic policy in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>The New Republic</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Boston Globe</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>&nbsp;and is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Counterinsurgent's Constitution: Law in the Age of Small Wars</i>, which won the 2013 Palmer Civil Liberties Prize. He is a graduate of Harvard Law School, where he was an editor on the <i>Harvard Law Review</i>.Chapter One<br><br>From Athens to America: The Two Traditions<br><br>By the time the Constitution was ratified, John Adams was out of touch with the mainstream of American constitutional thinking. He was perhaps the deepest thinker, the most thoughtful, and the best read among the revolutionaries, and his Thoughts on Government in 1776 guided them as they drafted state constitutions. Adams himself drafted the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780. But in 1787, his tome titled A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America appeared to come from a bygone era. Adams himself recognized this, writing to a friend, &#x201c;This Book will make me unpopular.&#x201d;<br><br>What made Adams an outlier wasn&#x2019;t the structure of the government he proposed. His suggestion looked similar to the Constitution drafted at Philadelphia that summer. He, too, proposed a system of separated powers, with an executive branch and a bicameral legis�lature. The difference was his justification for that structure. By 1787, Americans firmly believed in popular sovereignty, and they saw both the House of Representatives and the Senate as rooted in the will of the people. Two houses in the legislature simply served as a check on the exercise of power by slowing the legislative process and cooling passions. In the Defence and in his other writings, Adams justified the two houses based on social class. He believed, in the words of the historian Gordon Wood, that &#x201c;government bore an intimate relation to society and unless the two were reconciled no state could long remain secure.&#x201d; While America seemed like an egalitarian society without &#x201c;distinctions of ranks,&#x201d; Americans would be driven to &#x201c;better their condition [and] advance their fortunes[] without limits.&#x201d; This natural desire to acquire more wealth would cause social divisions between &#x201c;the rich and the poor, the laborious and the idle, the learned and the ignorant.&#x201d; The task of constitutional government was to &#x201c;regulate and not to eradicate&#x201d; such divisions, which would invariably be reduced to two&#x2014;�the rich and the poor. No society, Adams thought, could be truly equal. There was &#x201c;no special providence for Americans,&#x201d; who were just &#x201c;like all other people, and shall do like other nations.&#x201d; And so John Adams, a hero of America&#x2019;s democratic Revolution, argued that there needed to be one house for the &#x201c;rich, the well-�born, and the able&#x201d; and another for the common people of the country. Each class would serve as a check on the other because &#x201c;[n]othing but Force and Power and Strength can restrain&#x201d; groups of people against &#x201c;their Avarice or Ambition.&#x201d; Adams thought he was protecting against oligarchy by confining the rich to one house of the legislature. It was an &#x201c;ostracism,&#x201d; he said. But critics at the time found Adams&#x2019;s position surprising. America did not have an aristocracy, they said. So why create one? Decades later, John Taylor (&#x201c;of Caroline,&#x201d; as he was known) called Adams&#x2019;s Defence a &#x201c;caricature or travesty&#x201d; of American constitutional thinking. It made a &#x201c;radical errour&#x201d; in envisioning &#x201c;our division of power, as the same principle with his balance of [social] orders.&#x201d;<br><br>It might seem puzzling that the man who would become the first vice president of the United States thought the American Constitution should align economic classes with the branches of government. But it is only puzzling when compared with the democratic tendencies unleashed by the American Revolution and by our own modern commitment to an egalitarian democracy. To understand why Adams was such an outlier&#x2014;�and how radical the American Constitution was&#x2014;�we have to go back in time, to the intellectual traditions that Adams and the founding generation inherited.<br><br>For much of the history of constitutional thought, political theorists and statesmen believed economic inequality was inevitable in society and was one of the central challenges, if not the central challenge, of constitutional design. Either the rich would tyrannize the poor, or the poor would oppress the rich. The result would be oligarchy, mob rule, or constant strife. The way to create a stable government was to build economic classes directly into the structure of government, thereby creating a balance between wealthy and ordinary citizens. These class warfare constitutions mirrored the economic inequality in society and mitigated its deleterious effects. For political theorists, the Roman republic, with its patrician senate and tribune of the plebs, served as a detailed case study in this tradition of constitutional design.<br><br>But there was a second response to this problem as well, albeit one that was much more speculative. Political theorists in this second tradition recognized that societies might not be divided only into rich and poor. There could be a third group&#x2014;�a middle class. In these societies, if the middle class was large enough and strong enough, it could hold the balance of power between rich and poor. The middle class would govern wisely, without any of the vices that afflict the impoverished or the affluent. Middle-�class constitutions would not need to be defined by structures mirroring economic inequality. A different kind of governmental structure&#x2014;�a democracy or commonwealth&#x2014;�might be possible.<br><br>The intellectual history that undergirds these two traditions is obscure today, and it requires an in-�depth exploration into history from ancient Greece through the eighteenth century. But it provides the baseline for understanding what made the American Constitution exceptional and for seeing the connection between political power and economic conditions. If economic power and political power became mismatched, the result would be instability, strife, and even revolution.<br><br>Athenian Exceptionalism<br><br>Around 600 b.c., economic tensions in Athens were running high. Overseas colonization meant greater wealth for the already wealthy landowners, in addition to access to foreign luxuries. At the same time, poorer families were at risk of being sold into slavery or forced to sell their labor to pay off their debts. &#x201c;The disparity between the rich and the poor had culminated, as it were, and the city was in an altogether perilous condition,&#x201d; the historian Plutarch wrote. &#x201c;It seemed as if the only way to settle its disorders and stop its turmoils was to establish a tyranny.&#x201d; But the Athenians did not establish a tyranny. Instead, they called forth one of their more distinguished citizens, Solon, who &#x201c;was neither associated with the rich in their injustice, nor involved in the necessities of the poor.&#x201d;<br><br>In 594 b.c., Solon adopted two major reforms that fundamentally changed the relationship between the rich and the poor in Athens. First, he abolished debt bondage and forgave existing debts. The poor could never be truly equal citizens if they were at risk of needing to sell themselves into slavery. Ending debt bondage meant that over time poverty would not lead to political inequality. The second reform was a significant revision of the political and legal system, particularly an expansion of the scope of who could hold office. Instead of relying on birth status as a qualification for holding office, Solon shifted to a wealth requirement, based on agricultural production. Here, too, the reforms had longer-�term significance: they expanded political mobility. With the shift from birth to wealth, even the poor could potentially raise their economic standing and attain political leadership. As part of his legal reforms, Solon also created a popular law court in which anyone who was injured&#x2014;�rich or poor&#x2014;�could bring suit against those who had wronged him, and he established the Council of 400, an assembly with members from different wealth classes. Solon&#x2019;s reforms, Plutarch tells us, &#x201c;pleased neither party.&#x201d; &#x201c;The rich were vexed because he took away their securities for debt, and the poor still more, because he did not redistribute the land, as they had expected, nor make all men equal and alike in their way of living.&#x201d; Solon&#x2019;s reforms put Athens on the path to becoming the democracy that Pericles would herald as a model for the world, where &#x201c;everyone is equal before the law&#x201d; and &#x201c;political life is free and open.&#x201d; Over the next few hundred years, Athenian reformers would expand political equality even further, making Athens the deliberative democracy we think of today.<br><br>What made Athenian democracy work? First was a set of political reforms that established democratic equality. The second great Athenian reformer, Cleisthenes, helped create a democratic identity with his reforms in 507 b.c. He eliminated Solon&#x2019;s wealth classes and instead divided Athens into ten tribes based on 140 different areas of residence, with each tribe sending members to the now-�expanded Council of 500. The result was a shift from wealth to geography, creating broader, more equal representation in the council. In addition, Cleisthenes adopted reforms to prevent notable individuals from accumulating too much power within the city. Members of the Council of 500 could serve only twice in their lifetimes and for one year each. He also introduced the practice of ostracism, by which the assembly could exile a member of the city. In the fifth century, Athens used ostracism fifteen times, largely to exclude people who were feared to have grown too powerful and were suspected of wanting to become tyrants. Ostracism ensured that the people writ large had a check on the wealthy and powerful.<br><br>After Cleisthenes, further reforms extended equality in Athens. The city-�state shifted selection of its top officials from election to lottery. Property qualifications for office were reduced and then eliminated altogether. At the end of the fifth century, the march of Athenian democracy was halted by a generation of warfare during and after the Peloponnesian War. Starting in 411 b.c., Athens went through a series of constitutional revolutions in just under a decade: an oligarchy took over in 411, only to be swiftly replaced by the rule of &#x201c;the 5,000,&#x201d; followed by the reintroduction of democracy in 410. Sparta defeated Athens in 404, and the &#x201c;thirty tyrants&#x201d; took over the city. Finally, in 403, Athens again became a democracy.<br><br>For much of the next century, Athens flourished. This was the golden age of Athens&#x2014;�of Plato and Aristotle, poets and playwrights. It was also the pinnacle of Athenian democracy. The assembly was no longer restricted by wealth or property qualifications: any male citizen could participate. Within the Council of 500, which set the agenda for the assembly, a tenth of the members composed the executive body, whose rotating chair was selected by lottery and only served for twenty-�four hours, to prevent the chair from accumulating inordinate power. The courts had juries of between two hundred and fifteen hundred people, chosen by lottery from panels of six thousand. Jurors had to be citizens over the age of thirty. Of the twelve hundred officials in the city, only about a hundred were elected, which included ten generals&#x2014;�the rest were selected by lottery. Throughout this time, economic inequalities never resulted in rebellion.<br><br>Of course, by modern standards, Athens doesn&#x2019;t seem like the ideal democracy. Women, foreigners, and slaves were excluded from participating in politics. But although Athenian political freedom was in part built on the backs of women and slaves, the story is not so simple �as that might suggest. When compared with other city-�states at the time, Athens was extraordinarily open. Not only was oligarchy the most common form of government in fourth-�century b.c. Greece, but, as the classicist Josiah Ober once noted, &#x201c;[f]or the first time in the recorded history of a complex society, all native freeborn males, irrespective of their ability, family connections, or wealth, were political equals, with equal rights to determine state policy.&#x201d;<br><br>Just as important, democratic deliberation in Athens was not limited to wealthy elites who did not need to work. At the time, there were twenty thousand to thirty thousand Athenian citizens: adult men who were not foreigners or slaves. About twelve hundred to two thousand of these citizens were wealthy enough to form the &#x201c;leisure class&#x201d; that did not need to work, a number that jumps to forty-�eight hundred to eight thousand if we include their families. In other words, only about 5 to 10 percent of citizens were in the highest echelon of economic class. When the Athenian assembly met at Pnyx, the hill that was home to the city&#x2019;s six-�thousand-�citizen democratic debates, it was not a gathering controlled or dominated by the richest Athenians. Even if all of the economically elite citizens in Athens attended, they would compose only about one-�third of the assembly.<br><br>While some at the time, like the now cheekily named &#x201c;Old Oligarch,&#x201d; complained that the poor ran the government, Athens was remarkably wealthy and surprisingly equal in its distribution of wealth. Estimates we have of wages suggest that a great number of Athenians earned enough &#x201c;to enable them to live decent lives.&#x201d; Our evidence of housing patterns corroborates this evidence. If ancient Greece was severely stratified by wealth, we would expect to see archaeological evidence of mansions (for the rich) and small huts (for the poor). But the archaeological record instead clusters around the middle, with few extremely small or large houses. &#x201c;Wealth was distributed relatively equitably across Greek populations&#x201d;; Josiah Ober concludes, &#x201c;there was a substantial middle class of people who lived well above bare subsistence yet below the level of elite consumption.&#x201d;<br><br>To enable the many working middle-�class citizens to participate in politics, the people of Athens made a second policy choice. They did not assume that relative economic equality would prevent those who were on the wealthier side from dominating politics. To make democracy work, they paid for widespread participation. Starting in the mid&#x2013;fifth century b.c., Athens paid citizens a per diem for attending the assembly and later expanded the per diem to include jury service.35 Normally, men, women, and children all had to work simply to sustain the family. The payment for political participation offset the losses that accompanied being absent from a day of work. The result was to expand who could govern the Greek city-�state to those even of modest means.<br><br>Economic equality and equal political participation were not the only features that allowed Athenian democracy to flourish. Athenian political culture worked to guard against the informal advantages that wealthy individuals could parlay into outsized political power. Because the wealthy could pay for education and had leisure time to develop oratory skills, they were more likely to participate in and dominate the assembly. The famed orator Demosthenes is said to have deliberately shaved off half the hair on his head. Too ashamed to leave his house, he would have to practice oratory for months at a time while his hair grew back. Speakers before the assembly knew that the crowd was vigilant and skeptical of those who accumulated influence, and so orators (especially wealthy ones) were careful to flatter the people. Demosthenes himself captured the depth of this concern, attempting to clothe his oratorical preparation in a populist garb: &#x201c;[H]e who rehearsed his speeches was a true man of the people: for such preparation was a mark of deference to the people, whereas heedlessness of what the multitude will think of his speech marks a man of oligarchical spirit, and one who relies on force rather than on persuasion.&#x201d;</p><h2>Doug Welsh&#39;s Texas Garden Almanac (Month-by-Month Guide)</h2><p>Think of Doug Welsh&#x2019;s Texas Garden Almanac as a giant monthly calendar for the entire state a practical, information-packed, month-by-month guide for gardeners and yardeners.&#x201d; This book provides everything you need to know about flowers and garden design; trees, shrubs, and vines; lawns; vegetable, herb, and fruit gardening; and soil, mulch, water, pests, and plant care.

Excerpt from book: in the practice of all those nameless orgies which made a by-word of Corinth during the first century. Every evil was traced to woman. A curious old black letter volume published in London, 1632, declares that &#34;the reason why women have no control in Parliament, why they make no laws, consent to none, abrogate none, is their original sin.&#34; CHAPTER IV. MARQUETTE. The minds of people having been corrupted through centuries by the doctrines of the Church in regard to woman, it became an easy step for the State to aid in her degradation. The system of feudalism arising from the theory that warfare was the normal condition of man, still oppressed woman by bringing into power a class of men accustomed to deeds of violence, who found their chief pleasure in the sufferings of others. To be a woman, appealed to no instinct of tenderness in this class. To be a woman was not to be protected unless such woman held power in her own right, or acted in place of some feudal lord. The whole body of villeins and serfs were under absolute dominion of the feudal lords.

Here she departs from more familiar pseudohistorical European settings for the Celestial Empire, a land where life moves in eternal circles and the wishes of departed ancestors can have as much influence as the living on day-to-day life. Itinerant ex-priestess Maskelle was once the Voice of the Adversary, vessel to a spirit created by the Ancestors and given the task of punishing injustice and evil. When a false message from an interfering evil spirit led her to commit murder, Maskelle left the faith, only to return now, years later, answering the summons of the Celestial One. Someone--or something--has corrupted the great Wheel of the Infinite, distorting the sacred patterns which must be faithfully recreated at the end of each year to ensure the continual existence of the world. The only way to repair the pattern is to find the being responsible for disturbing it, and so the Adversary's Voice is needed once again, despite the past. Assisted by the swordsman Rian, a lordless bodyguard from distant Sitane, Maskelle uncovers an intricate plot whose roots were set into motion long ago--a plot responsible for the murder which forced her to leave the faith. Engaging characters and a convincing setting make this novel of ancient schemes and twisted magic an excellent and memorable read. <i>--Charlene Brusso</i>Martha Wells was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and received her B.A. in anthropology from Texas A &amp; M University.

The Witch of the Waste was another matter.</p><p>After fifty years of quiet, it was rumored that the Witch was about to terrorize the country again. So when a moving black castle, blowing dark smoke from its four thin turrets, appeared on the horizon, everyone thought it was the Witch. The castle, however, belonged to Wizard Howl, who, it was said, liked to suck the souls of young girls.</p><p>The Hatter sisters--Sophie, Lettie, and Martha--and all the other girls were warned not to venture into the streets alone. But that was only the beginning.</p><p>In this giant jigsaw puzzle of a fantasy, people and things are never quite what they seem. Destinies are intertwined, identities exchanged, lovers confused. The Witch has placed a spell on Howl. Does the clue to breaking it lie in a famous poem? And what will happen to Sophie Hatter when she enters Howl's castle?</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones's entrancing fantasy is filled with surprises at every turn, but when the final stormy duel between the Witch and the Wizard is finished, all the pieces fall magically into place.</p></p><p>In which a witch bewitched the hatter's daughter -- and then some. . . .<p>Sophie lived in the town of Market Chipping, which was in Ingary, a land in which anything could happen, and often did -- especially when the Witch of the Waste got her dander up. Which was often.</p><p>As her younger sisters set out to seek their fortunes, Sophie stayed in her father's hat shop. Which proved most unadventurous, until the Witch of the Waste came in to buy a bonnet, but was not pleased. Which is why she turned Sophie into an old lady. Which was spiteful witchery.</p><p>Now Sophie must seek her own fortune. Which means striking a bargain with the lecherous Wizard Howl. Which means entering his ever-moving castle, taming a blue fire-demon, and meeting the Witch of the Waste head-on. Which was more than Sophie bargained for. . . .</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones (1934-2011) wrote more than forty books of fantasy for young readers.

The Allied generals knew the fighting would end precisely at 11:00 A.M, yet in the final hours they flung men against an already beaten Germany. The result? Eleven thousand casualties suffered&#x2013;more than during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Why? Allied commanders wanted to punish the enemy to the very last moment and career officers saw a fast-fading chance for glory and promotion. <br><br>Joseph E. Persico puts the reader in the trenches with the forgotten and the famous&#x2013;among the latter, Corporal Adolf Hitler, Captain Harry Truman, and Colonels Douglas MacArthur and George Patton. Mainly, he follows ordinary soldiers&#x2019; lives, illuminating their fate as the end approaches. Persico sets the last day of the war in historic context with a gripping reprise of all that led up to it, from the 1914 assassination of the Austrian archduke, Franz Ferdinand, which ignited the war, to the raw racism black doughboys endured except when ordered to advance and die in the war&#x2019;s last hour. Persico recounts the war&#x2019;s bloody climax in a cinematic style that evokes <i>All Quiet on the Western Front, Grand Illusion, </i>and<i> Paths of Glory.</i><br><br>The pointless fighting on the last day of the war is the perfect metaphor for the four years that preceded it, years of senseless slaughter for hollow purposes. This book is sure to become the definitive history of the end of a conflict Winston Churchill called &#x201c;the hardest, cruelest, and least-rewarded of all the wars that have been fought.&#x201d;<br></p><p>JOSEPH E. PERSICO&#x2019;s books include <i>Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial</i>, which was made into a television docudrama; <i>Piercing the Reich, </i>on the penetration of Nazi Germany by American agents; <i>My American Journey</i> (as collaborator with Colin Powell); and <i>Roosevelt&#x2019;s Secret War</i>. He lives in Guilderland, New York.1<br><br>The Desperate Hours<br><br>November 11, 1918. The runner, shivering, his breath visible in the morning air, waited for the captain to acknowledge the message. The night had been bitter, the temperature hovering near freezing. The cold had stiffened the mud, caking uniforms and frosting the rim of the trench. Leaden skies threatened snow. A medic moved along the duckboards handing out aspirin to sneezing, hacking men with heavy colds. They gripped tin mugs of coffee, grateful for the warmth, and eyed the runner, wondering what news he bore.<br><br>The captain read the message twice. It must be a mistake. True, the night before, the U.S. 26th Division had received Field Order 105 to attack at 9:30 this morning. But at 9:10, just as they had been checking their ammunition and fixing bayonets, word came that the armistice had been signed. Hostilities were to cease at 11 a.m. The attack had been canceled. And here was another message telling the captain that the assault had been reinstated. His watch showed 10:30. A half hour remained in the war.<br><br>To Private Connell Albertine, in Company A of the division&#x2019;s 104th Infantry, the earlier word that the assault had been canceled had produced deep, wordless relief. He would live. Rumors that an armistice was imminent had been rife for days. And at 5:45 that morning, the division&#x2019;s radiomen had picked up a message transmitted from the Eiffel Tower in Paris from the Allied commander, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, confirming the signing. That the attack would now go forward, after having been rescinded, struck him as insane, even murderous. Seventeen months had passed since the fresh-faced young New Englander had stood with the crowd reading the bulletin in the window of The Boston Globe. A giant keyboard tapped out on an unfolding paper roll, &#x201c;A state of War between the Imperial German Government which has been thrust upon the United States is hereby declared.&#x201d; President Woodrow Wilson&#x2019;s long agony, his peaceful impulses pitted against the tide of events, had led him to take his nation into Europe&#x2019;s conflict, just five months after he had been reelected president on the slogan &#x201c;He kept us out of the War.&#x201d; The personal import of the Globe&#x2019;s bulletin was immediately evident to Albertine. He belonged to the Massachusetts National Guard, and its mobilization would be inevitable. &#x201c;An indescribable feeling swelled within me,&#x201d; he recalled of that day, &#x201c;driving out all thoughts of my work and daily routine and filling me with an urgent desire to hasten to my gathering buddies and the comfort of my rifle.&#x201d;<br><br>Since then, intervening realities had cooled his ardor. In the beginning, war had seemed a romp. The 104th had first entered the trenches in a quiet sector of the western front near Toul in northeast France. In the evenings, the doughboys could hear the sounds of a violin rising from the enemy trenches. When the Germans realized that they were facing Americans, they had behaved as if they had found long-lost family. They came out into no-man&#x2019;s-land offering sausages for American cigarettes, black bread for white. &#x201c;Hey, Yank!&#x201d; one called out. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;re you from?&#x201d; When the soldier replied, &#x201c;Boston,&#x201d; the German responded, &#x201c;I was a bartender at Jake Wirth&#x2019;s.&#x201d; The camaraderie ended abruptly when regimental headquarters at Toul brought court-martial proceedings against twelve soldiers for fraternizing with the enemy. Soon after, the opposing artillery batteries began exchanging fire.<br><br>February 17, 1918, stood out starkly in Albertine&#x2019;s memory. He had been crouched in a funkhole clawed from the earth watching geysers of dirt heaved up by exploding shells. A blast over a nearby company tossed up what looked like a rag doll. Albertine watched the stretcher bearers drag a lifeless form from a shell hole. The 104th had taken its first fatality, Private George G. Clarke, Company E.<br><br>Soon afterward, through the din of artillery fire, Albertine heard the wail of a klaxon. Gas alert. He pulled his mask over his face just as shells of mustard gas fell to earth with a seemingly innocent thump. They did not explode but issued a pinging sound and then a whistle as the fumes escaped. The gas had caught nearby French troops asleep. Albertine watched the victims being carted from the field, coughing up bits of their lungs, the exposed parts of their bodies blistered, their eyelids swollen shut, blinding them.<br><br>Through the months that followed, Albertine had worn the psychological armor that kept soldiers fighting: these things happened to others, not me. That was before the incident in the churchyard cemetery. They had been moving among the graves when shells began exploding close by. As Albertine flung himself to the ground, he felt something cold and hard under his hand, a cast-iron marker blown off a cross. He stared in disbelief. The marker bore the name &#x201c;Albertine.&#x201d; He flung it aside but, as the months wore on, could never erase its portent from his memory.<br><br>The 104th had fought through Ch�teau-Thierry and Saint- Mihiel and was now deployed in the Verdun sector. On the morning of the armistice, when it had appeared the assault had been canceled, Albertine could finally believe that he had outlasted the war. He glanced toward Chaplain de Valles, whom he credited with his survival.<br><br>John B. de Valles had been born in the Azores to Portuguese parents who had taken him to Massachusetts as a child. He had been ordained in 1906 and became a popular parish priest, first in Fall River and then in New Bedford. When America went to war, Father de Valles immediately joined the Chaplains&#x2019; Corps. His popularity transferred easily to the 104th. When a soldier found himself short before payday, the priest could be touched for a loan of a few francs&#x2014;on one condition: he must promise not to use the money for what de Valles called &#x201c;cohabitation.&#x201d; His orderly kept a ledger in which the loans were recorded. But when payday came around, Father de Valles would tell him to tear out the page. The orderly was Connell Albertine, who looked upon the day the chaplain had chosen him as the luckiest of his young life.<br><br>Albertine felt secure in the priest&#x2019;s presence. The previous April, near Saint-Agnant, when Private Burns had been hung up on the wire in no-man&#x2019;s-land, screaming in agony, Chaplain de Valles heaved himself out of the trench and began crawling toward the wounded man. The priest disentangled Burns from the wire, lifted him onto his back, and staggered to the trench as enemy machine-gun bullets tore into the ground around them.<br><br>After bloody fighting at Commercy, de Valles had stood mutely watching a procession of carts haul the 104th&#x2019;s dead from the field. Albertine heard Father de Valles curse through clenched teeth, &#x201c;Kill them! Kill the bastards!&#x201d; The priest later apologized to his orderly, but the words, he said, had tumbled out and felt right. The incident had bound Albertine more closely to the chaplain, making de Valles as humanly imperfect as his flock.<br><br>Now, on this last day, the nightmare of raglike bodies, gas-seared lungs, and unholy shrieks from the wire, he believed, had to end.<br><br> Colonel Cassius M. Dowell commanded another regiment of the 26th Division, the 103rd. That November 11, Dowell was in his dugout bent over a map, marking the point where his regiment could expect to end the war. At 9:45 a.m., his field phone rang. Colonel Duncan K. Major, the division&#x2019;s chief of staff, was on the line informing him that the attack had been reinstated. Dowell was to send his men against German machine guns in a war that would end in a little over an hour. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Dowell asked. &#x201c;The French compelled us to do it,&#x201d; Major answered. The 26th was in fact under command of the French II Colonial Corps. Major had experienced his own disbelief when told that the canceled assault was now to go forward. He had checked with the operations chief of the French corps for confirmation. Major, his French imperfect, feared he had misunderstood. An American liaison officer serving with the French came on the line and informed Major that he had heard correctly. The assault was back on. This was the news that Major was now relaying to disbelieving regimental commanders of the 26th.<br><br>Cassius Dowell, now in his sixteenth year in the army, was gruff, plainspoken, an officer who had risen from private to his present rank. He was not without compassion for his men, but was a soldier first. He too had learned unofficially from a friend on division staff that the armistice had been signed just after 5 a.m. He had not shared this information with his men &#x201c;lest it might interfere with their advance during the attack that had been ordered for that day.&#x201d; He had then received word that the assault, except for the artillery bombardment, had been called off. He could not, however, resist one last blow at the Hun. He warned that if any shells were left unfired at 11 a.m., he would court-martial the responsible battery commander.<br><br>On learning that the attack had been fully reinstated, &#x201c;I stood there a few seconds debating as to whether I should send my men forward, having told them that they would not have to go,&#x201d; Dowell later recalled. &#x201c;I expected my casualties to be very heavy.&#x201d;<br><br>Lieutenant Harry G. Rennagel, released from the hospital just the day before, rejoined his unit of the 26th Division to find his men laughing, joking, talking more loudly than they ever dared in the trenches. They were &#x201c;waiting for the bell to ring,&#x201d; they told him, signaling the end of the war. &#x201c;When the orders came to go over the top,&#x201d; he remembered, &#x201c;we thought it was a joke.&#x201d;<br><br>Albertine watched Chaplain de Valles move through the trench, deathly pale, comforting the men. An Italian private from Boston&#x2019;s North End asked the chaplain to bless him and kissed the cross hanging from t...</p><h2>Mufaro&#39;s Beautiful Daughters: An African Tale</h2><p>Mufaro&#39;s two beautiful daughters, one bad-tempered, one kind and sweet, go before the king, who is choosing a wife.</p><p><p>Mufaro was a happy man.

One of the keenest was a certain W. C. Minor, who astonished and dismayed everyone by declining ever to come to Oxford to receive his congratulations until, reputedly, his refusals eventually prompted the Dictionary&#39;s editor, James Murray, to travel down to Crowthorne, in Berkshire to meet him. What he found was utterly shocking. Minor was a millionaire American Civil War surgeon turned lunatic, imprisoned in Broadmoor Asylum for murder, who had dedicated his entire cell bound life to work on the English language.

Over the years the series developed steadily, latterly with the incorporation of sophisticated, fetishistic sex scenes. The Swords of Lankhmar (1968) is reckoned one of the best sword and sorcery (Leiber invented the term) yarns ever, with 1988's collection, The Knight and Knave of Swords, not far behind. The publisher tells us that Leiber chose Bailey to collaborate on a new series of Lankhmar adventures; this first entry is, chronologically, a sequel to Ill-Met in Lankhmar (1970). If you loved Lankhmar, consider the whole concept too alluring to be allowed to die with its creator, and dont mind ersatz, then assuredly youll wish to reconnoiter.

With <b>John Henry Days</b>, Colson Whitehead delivers on the promise of his critically acclaimed debut in a magnificent new novel: a retelling of the legend of John Henry that sweeps across generations and cultures in a stunning, hilarious, and unsettling portrait of American society.<br><br>Immortalized in folk ballads, John Henry has been a favorite American hero since the mid-nineteenth century. According to legend, John Henry, a black laborer for the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad, was a man of superhuman strength and stamina. He proved his mettle in a contest with a steam drill, only to die of exhaustion moments after his triumph. <br><br>In <b>John Henry Days</b>, Colson Whitehead transforms the simple ballad into a contrapuntal masterpiece. The narrative revolves around the story of J. Sutter, a young black journalist. Sutter is a "junketeer," a freeloading hack who roams from one publicity event to another, abusing his expense account and mooching as much as possible. It is 1996, and an assignment for a travel Web site takes Sutter to West Virginia for the first annual "John Henry Days" festival, a celebration of a new U.S. postal stamp honoring John Henry. And there the real story of John Henry emerges in graceful counterpoint to Sutter's thoroughly modern adventure.<br><br>As he explores the parallels between the lives of these two black men, and between the Industrial Age, which literally killed John Henry, and the Digital Age that is destroying J. Sutter's soul, Whitehead adds multiple dimensions to the myth of the steel-driving man. And in dazzling set pieces, he traces the evolution of the famous ballad over the past century. <b>John Henry Days</b><i> </i>is a novel of extraordinary scope and mythic power that juxtaposes history and popular culture, the blatant bigotry of the past with the more insidious racism of the present, and laugh-out-loud humor with unforgettable poignancy.</p><p>Colson Whitehead's second novel posits a folk antihero for the information age: junketeer and puff-piece-writing man J. Sutter. For his latest assignment, this freelance hack is sent to Talcott, West Virginia, to cover its John Henry Days festival and the unveiling of the United States Postal Service's John Henry stamp. Sutter hasn't devoted much thought to American mythology lately, or to the epic struggle of man vs. machine, or to anything else besides padding his expense account and cadging free drinks. Still, our hero is engaged in a private contest of his own--a kind of junket jag, in which he plans to attend a public relations event every single day. Alas, this journalistic obstacle course threatens to eradicate Sutter's soul, just as the folkloric steam shovel eradicated John Henry's body. Whitehead cuts back and forth between eras and exploits. And what begins as a media-saturated satire soon turns into a jazzy, expansive meditation on man, machine, nature, race, history, myth, and pop culture--in short, on America, as expressed through the story of (who else?) a former slave.<p> Following on the heels of Whitehead's widely praised debut, <i>The Intuitionist</i>, <i>John Henry Days</i> won't disappoint anyone who delighted in the first book's wonderfully quirky writing or its complex allegories of race. The historical set pieces here dazzle, and the author casts a withering eye on our media-driven culture: "Since the days of Gutenberg, an ambient hype wafted the world, throbbing and palpitating. From time to time, some of that material cooled, forming bodies of dense publicity." Still, these brilliant parts don't necessarily add up to a satisfying whole. Whitehead writes the kind of smart, allusive, highly wrought prose that is impressive sentence by sentence. Over the course of 400 pages, though, it can be somewhat daunting. It's a bit like eating a meal in which each of the seven courses comes topped with hollandaise sauce. Worse, some of the characters' motivations remain abstract, as if the author hovered so far above his creations that their foibles struck him as simple absurdities. In a novel of this caliber, of course, much can be forgiven. But one is eager to see Whitehead quit riffing and make an emotional investment in his characters. The result will be fiction that engages the heart as well as the head. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Praise for Colson Whitehead's <b>The Intuitionist</b>:<b><br><br></b>"Magical...

You can take the morning paper at face value and believe the world oscillates between the dumb-show of &#34;left-wing&#34; and &#34;right-wing&#34;. Or you can begin to question this national hypnosis. A guidebook to alternative views of contemporary events and world history, Secret and Suppressed confronts the reader with disquieting revelations on mind control, secret societies, media disinformation, cults, and elite cabals. The hard evidence supplied by many of these articles is startling. Other entries veer into the twilight realm of paranoia, speculation, and horror. If you believe that ignorance is bliss then Secret and Suppressed is sure to make you very unhappy.</p><p></p><h2>West to a Land of Plenty: The Diary of Teresa Angelino Viscardi, New York to Idaho Territory, 1883 (Dear America)</h2><p>The first humorous addition to the historical fiction series is narrated by Teresa, a first generation American of Italian descent, who travels by train and then by wagon with her family from New York to a utopian community in Idaho.</p><p><p>Gr 4-8--Italian-American Teresa Viscardi and her family travel to the Idaho Territory along with a number of other Easterners to settle in a town aptly named Opportunity. Her diary begins on the train that will take them to the Dakota Territory where they must then buy wagons, oxen, and horses to transport them across the rugged landscape. Teresa struggles to understand her father's decision to move thousands of miles from the home she loves, admires her mother's strength and courage, and accepts her younger sister Netta's persistence in reading and writing in her diary. After suffering through sickness, the presence of Indians, her father's sudden silver fever, and Netta's subsequent death, Teresa finds solace and comfort in her family's ability to stay together. Reminiscent of a Willa Cather heroine, the girl is resourceful, strong-minded, and intelligent. Her coming-of-age is complete after she saves herself and her grandmother from thieves. Engaging, colorful characters abound. Teresa's last entry, in the epilogue dated 1952, speaks of the woman's contentment with her life and the peace she feels. It is addressed to Netta, Teresa's way of keeping her sister's memory alive.

"We are not living from our authentic selves." <i>Journey into Power</i> offers more than yoga poses; it also aims to "rewire your mind" and "recharge your spiritual batteries." <p> Baptiste's program, based on his weeklong "Journey into Power" boot camps, integrates the physical and spiritual components of yoga. His daily "Power Vinyasa Yoga Practice," done in a heated room, is a challenging series of 54 yoga poses, one flowing into another. The poses are well illustrated and clearly described, including modifications. Baptiste encourages you to reach your edge ("where we come right up against ourselves and what we can do and be") by holding a pose for a breath longer than you think you can or stretching a quarter-inch farther. </p><p> Eight spiritual/psychological principles, described cogently and often lyrically, guide the transformation process.

A middle-aged mother who spends much of her time shuttling her numerous offspring along twisting mountain roads loses control of her car and ends up injured but alive in a gorge. Meanwhile, an elderly man of unbreakable habits is taunted and threatened by two unknown men while on his morning walk along the cliffs of Brittany. Mystery abounds but <i>A Novel Bookstore</i> is no everyday mystery. The victims here are not members of the underworld, toughs or thugs, but mild, meek and apparently ordinary people. In the eyes of their aggressors, they are guilty of only one crime: expressing their tastes in literature.&nbsp;<br><br>Indeed, all three victims are members of The Good Novel's secret selection committee. Tucked away in a corner of Paris, The Good Novel bookstore offers its clientele literary masterpieces, both contemporary and classic, selected by a top-secret committee of authors. The store has proven an instant success, but nobody could have imagined that success would unleash a tide of hatred. Now, there are those who will stop at nothing to destroy The Good Novel. One by one, the pieces of this puzzle fall ominously into place, as it becomes clear to the store's owners, Ivan and Francesca, that their dreams of an ideal place for books may be shattered by envy and violence. <br><br>Elegantly mixing the mystery and literary fiction genres, Laurence Coss� has written an enthralling fable for lovers of good books and a heartfelt tribute to fine bookselling.</p><p>Born in 1950 in Boulogne-Billancourt, <b>Laurence&nbsp;Coss� </b>is a critic, novelist, playwright and journalist. She has reported for <i>Radio France</i> and the newspaper <i>Le Quotidien de Paris</i> and interviewed such luminaries as&nbsp;Andrei Tarkovsky and Jorge Luis Borges.&nbsp;Coss� is the author of the satirical thriller, <i>The Corner of the Veil</i> (Scribner), and several historical novels including the bestselling <i>Prime Minister's Woman</i>. <i>A Novel Bookstore</i>&nbsp;is her ninth novel.

Their dream becomes reality when they open their own shop, The Good Novel, in a fine but unpretentious Paris arrondissement. Their inventory is comprised of recommendations from eight respected authors, an anonymous committee who submit lists of their 600 favorite books. With quiet fanfare, the store opens and immediately achieves great success. Notice is then taken by the mainstream press: Who are these elitists, and how dare they tell everyone what to read? Mayhem ensues. The blogosphere erupts; the Internet roils. Erstwhile competitors spring up overnight, pandering to pedestrian tastes and trumpeting their pseudoegalitarian ideals. Ivan and Francesca stoically try to take it in stride until three of their nominating committee members fall victim to near-fatal accidents. Enveloping this diabolical mystery in a delicate love story, Coss� crafts a luscious paean to bibliophilia, gracefully translated from the French by Anderson. Wry, sly, and coyly seditious, Coss�&#x2019;s piquant satire is a subtly wrought manifesto against blatant consumer manipulation and media malfeasance. --Carol Haggas</p><h2>Creation : Life and How to Make It</h2><p>Mankind now has within its grasp the power to synthesize true artificial life, playing out Dr Frankenstein&#39;s dream in both cyberspace and the real world.

He died in 1989.Chatwin is a protean writer ( On the Black Hill , The Songlines ) always capable of surprising and entertaining his readers. In this slim volume, he draws a satirical portrait of life in a Socialist stateand concludes that human nature is the same no matter what political winds are blowing. The last descendent of an old Czech family, the eponymous art dealer Kaspar Utz lives in Prague, where the Russian occupiers allow him to keep his priceless Meissen porcelain collection on condition that he bequeath it to the national museum. To the narrator, Utz represents the quintessential adapter, able to tolerate a repressive government as long as his private life is undisturbed. Obsessed with a passion to preserve these remnants of the bygone days of imperial glory, Utz implies that the figurines are more real, enduring and invulnerable than the gray world of Eastern Europe existing behind the Iron Curtain. But on his death a droll mystery is revealed; the fate of the collection is as much a result of the belated awakening of Utz's romantic nature as it is a joke against the political regime he despised. Befitting his narrative, Chatwin's spare, precise prose takes on a surrealist quality appropriate to the theater of the absurd. 40,000 first printing; $35,000 ad/promo; Literary Guild alternate. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Smokescreen</h2><p>Edward Lincoln is a worldwide celebrity who plays detectives on the big screen.

Developed by Dr. Karen Holinga, this program allows students to develop spelling skills naturally and at their own pace with the direction and encouragement of the instructor. Relying upon visual memory that&#39;s built through repeated reading and repeated writing, students will learn spelling through short daily activities that integrate copywork, reading, speaking, and listening, rather than relying on rote memorization for weekly tests. Spelling You See Level B: Jack and Jill is designed to move your student from the Phonetic Stage into the third developmental stage - Skill Development (see the More Information [PDF] for an explanation of each stage). Following stages, not grade level, this level is for developing readers who print easily with lowercase letters and who knows most letter sounds, including long and short vowels. Jack and Jill will provide practice in writing individual letters and in hearing the sounds they make in simple words. It will also provide opportunities for students to study words in the context of nursery rhymes by marking letter patterns, copying words and passages, and writing from dictation. This course relies upon teacher instruction and the (sold-separately) Jack and Jill Student Workbook Set cannot be completed without this instructor&#39;s handbook. It features the philosophy and overview for the program, frequently asked questions, as well as short instructions for each lesson and a &#34;Guide to Chunking.&#34; 72 pages with glossary, softcover. 9.25&#34; x 8&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>Stormcaster (Shattered Realms, 3)</h2><p><p><strong>From </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> bestselling author Cinda Williams Chima comes the third gripping adventure in the Shattered Realms series, where</strong> <strong>intricately interwoven storylines converge as the warring Seven Realms struggle to unite against a horrific tyrant. </strong></p><p>Vagabond seafarer Evan Strangward can move wind, waves, and weather, but his magical abilities can&#x2019;t protect him forever from the brutal Empress Celestine.

Toronto woke that morning to see itself cloaked and made over in white, and it was only November.</p><p>Cutting across Nathan Philips Square in front of the twin curves of the City Hall, Dave Martyniuk walked as carefully as he could and wished he&#x2019;d worn boots. As he maneuvered toward the restaurant entrance on the far side, he saw with some surprise that the other three were already waiting.</p><p>&#x201c;Dave,&#x201d; said sharp-eyed Kevin Laine. &#x201c;A new suit! When did this happen?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, everyone,&#x201d; Dave said. &#x201c;I got it last week. Can&#x2019;t wear the same corduroy jackets all year, can I?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A deep truth,&#x201d; said Kevin, grinning. He was wearing jeans and a sheepskin jacket. And boots. Having finished the obligatory apprenticeship with a law firm that Dave had just begun, Kevin was now immersed in the equally tedious if less formal six-month Bar Admission course. &#x201c;If that is a three-piece suit,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;my image of you is going to be irrevocably shattered.&#x201d;</p><p>Wordlessly, Dave unbuttoned his overcoat to reveal the shattering navy vest beneath.</p><p>&#x201c;Angels and ministers of grace defend us!&#x201d; Kevin exclaimed, crossing himself with the wrong hand while making the sign against evil with the other. Paul Schafer laughed. &#x201c;Actually,&#x201d; Kevin said, &#x201c;it looks very nice. Why didn&#x2019;t you buy it in your size?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Kev, give him a break!&#x201d; Kim Ford said. &#x201c;It <i>is</i> nice, Dave, and it fits perfectly. Kevin&#x2019;s feeling scruffy and jealous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not,&#x201d; Kevin protested. &#x201c;I am simply giving my buddy a hard time. If I can&#x2019;t tease Dave, who can I tease?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; said Dave. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tough, I can take it.&#x201d; But what he was remembering in that moment was the face of Kevin Laine the spring before, in a room in the Park Plaza Hotel. The face, and the flat, harshly mastered voice in which he&#x2019;d spoken, looking down at the wreckage of a woman on the floor:</p><p><i>&#x201c;To this I will make reply although he be a god and it mean my death.&#x201d;</i></p><p>You gave some latitude, Dave was thinking, to someone who&#x2019;d sworn an oath like that, even if his style was more than occasionally jarring. You gave latitude because what Kevin had done that evening was give voice, and not for the only time, to the mute rage in one&#x2019;s own heart.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Kim Ford softly, and Dave knew that she was responding to his thought and not his flippant words. Which would have been unsettling, were she not who she was, with her white hair, the green bracelet on her wrist, and the red ring on her finger that had blazed to bring them home. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go in,&#x201d; Kim said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve things to talk about.&#x201d;</p><p>Paul Schafer, the Twiceborn, had already turned to lead them through the door.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>How many shadings, Kevin was thinking, are there to helplessness? He remembered the feeling from the year before, watching Paul twist inward on himself in the months after Rachel Kincaid had died. A bad time, that was. But Paul had come out of it, had gone so far in three nights on the Summer Tree in Fionavar that he was beyond understanding in the most important ways. He was healed, though, and Kevin held to that as a gift from Fionavar, some recompense for what had been done to Jennifer by the god named Rakoth Maugrim, the Unraveller. Though recompense was hardly the word; there was no true compensation to be found in this or any other world, only the hope of retribution, a flame so faint, despite what he had sworn, it scarcely burned. What were any of them against a god? Even Kim, with her Sight, even Paul, even Dave, who had changed among the Dalrei on the Plain and had found a horn in Pendaran Wood.</p><p>And who was he, Kevin Laine, to swear an oath of revenge? It all seemed so pathetic, so ridiculous, especially here, eating fillet of sole in the Mackenzie King Dining Room, amid the clink of cutlery and the lunchtime talk of lawyers and civil servants.</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; said Paul, in a tone that made their setting instantly irrelevant. He was looking at Kim. &#x201c;Have you seen anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Stop pushing. If anything happens I&#x2019;ll tell you. Do you want it in writing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Easy, Kim,&#x201d; Kevin said. &#x201c;You have to understand how ignorant we feel. You&#x2019;re our only link.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not linked to anything now, and that&#x2019;s all there is to it. There&#x2019;s a place I have to find and I can&#x2019;t control my dreaming. It&#x2019;s in this world, that&#x2019;s all I know, and I can&#x2019;t go anywhere or do anything until I find it. Do you think I&#x2019;m enjoying this any more than you three are?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you send us back?&#x201d; Dave asked, unwisely.</p><p>&#x201c;I am not a goddamned subway system!&#x201d; Kim snapped. &#x201c;I got us out because the Baelrath was somehow unleashed. I can&#x2019;t do it on command.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which means we&#x2019;re stuck here,&#x201d; Kevin said.</p><p>&#x201c;Unless Loren comes for us,&#x201d; Dave amended.</p><p>Paul was shaking his head. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Dave asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Loren&#x2019;s playing hands-off, I think. He set things in motion, but he&#x2019;s leaving it up to us now, and some of the others.&#x201d;</p><p>Kim was nodding. &#x201c;He put a thread in the loom,&#x201d; she murmured, &#x201c;but he won&#x2019;t weave this tapestry.&#x201d; She and Paul exchanged a glance.</p><p>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d; Dave persisted. Kevin could hear the big man&#x2019;s frustration. &#x201c;He needs us&#x2014;or at least Kim and Paul. Why won&#x2019;t he come for us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because of Jennifer,&#x201d; said Paul quietly. After a moment he went on. &#x201c;He thinks we&#x2019;ve suffered enough. He won&#x2019;t impose anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>Kevin cleared his throat. &#x201c;As I understand it, though, whatever happens in Fionavar is going to be reflected here and in the other worlds too, wherever they are. Isn&#x2019;t that true?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is,&#x201d; said Kim calmly. &#x201c;It is true. Not immediately, perhaps, but if Rakoth takes dominion in Fionavar he takes dominion everywhere. There is only one Tapestry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even so,&#x201d; said Paul, &#x201c;we have to do it on our own. Loren won&#x2019;t demand it. If the four of us want to go back, we&#x2019;ll have to find a way ourselves.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The four of us?&#x201d; Kevin said. So much helplessness. He looked at Kim.</p><p>There were tears in her eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know. She won&#x2019;t see the three of you. She never goes out of the house. She talks to me about work and the weather, and the news, and she&#x2019;s, she&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s going ahead with it,&#x201d; Paul Schafer said.</p><p>Kimberly nodded.</p><p>Golden, she had been, Kevin remembered, from inside the sorrow.</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Paul. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my turn now.&#x201d;</p><p>Arrow of the God.</p><p>She&#x2019;d had a peephole placed in the door so she could see who was knocking. She was home most of the day, except for afternoon walks in the park nearby. There were often people at the door: deliveries, the gas man, registered mail. For a while at the beginning there had been, fatuously, flowers. She&#x2019;d thought Kevin was smarter than that. She didn&#x2019;t care whether or not that was a fair judgment. She&#x2019;d had a fight with Kim about it, when her roommate had come home one evening to find roses in the garbage can.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have any idea how he&#x2019;s feeling? Don&#x2019;t you care?&#x201d; Kimberly had shouted.</p><p>Answer: no, and no.</p><p>How could she come to such a human thing as caring, anymore? Numberless, the unbridged chasms between where she now was, and the four of them, and everyone else. To everything there yet clung the odor of the swan. She saw the world through the filtered unlight of Starkadh. What voice, what eyes seen through that green distortion, could efface the power of Rakoth, who had shoveled through her mind and body as if she, who had once been loved and whole, were so much slag?</p><p>She knew she was sane, did not know why.</p><p>One thing only pulled her forward into some future tense. Not a good thing, nor could it have been, but it was real, and random, and hers. She would not be gainsaid.</p><p>And so, when Kim had first told the other three, and they had come in July to argue with her, she had stood up and left the room. Nor had she seen Kevin or Dave or Paul since that day.</p><p>She would bear this child, the child of Rakoth Maugrim. She intended to die giving birth.</p><p>She would not have let him in, except that she saw that he was alone, and this was sufficiently unexpected to cause her to open the door.</p><p>Paul Schafer said, &#x201c;I have a story to tell. Will you listen?&#x201d;</p><p>It was cold on the porch. After a moment she stepped aside and he entered. She closed the door and walked into the living room. He hung up his coat in the hall closet and followed her.</p><p>She had taken the rocking chair. He sat down on the couch and looked at her, tall and fair, still graceful though no longer slim, seven months heavy with the child. Her head was high, her wide-set green eyes uncompromising.</p><p>&#x201c;I walked away from you last time, and I will again, Paul. I will not be moved on this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said, a story,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;Then tell it.&#x201d;</p><p>So he told her for the first time about the grey dog on the wall of Paras Derval and the fathomless sorrow in its eyes; he told her about his second night on the Summer Tree, when Galadan, whom she also knew, had come for him, and how the dog had appeared again, and of the battle fought here in the M�rnirwood. He told her about being bound on the Tree of the God, and seeing the red moon rise and the grey dog drive the wolf from the wood.</p><p>He told her of Dana. And M�rnir. The powers shown forth that night in answer to the Darkness in the north. His voice was deeper than she remembered; there were echoes in it.</p><p>He said, &#x201c;We are not in this alone. He may break us into fragments in the end, but he will not be unresisted, and whatever you may have seen or endured in that place you must understand that he cannot shape the pattern exactly to his desire. Or else you would not be here.&#x201d;</p><p>She listened, almost against her will. His words brought back words of her own, spoken in Starkadh itself: <i>You will have nothing of me that you do not take</i>, she had said. But that was before. Before he had set about taking everything&#x2014;until Kim had pulled her out.</p><p>She lifted her head a little. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Paul said, his eyes never leaving her face. &#x201c;Do you understand? He is stronger than any of us, stronger even than the God who sent me back. He is stronger than you, Jennifer; it is not worth saying except for this: he cannot take away what you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know this,&#x201d; said Jennifer Lowell. &#x201c;It is why I will bear his child.&#x201d;</p><p>He sat back. &#x201c;Then you become his servant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. You listen to me now, Paul, because you don&#x2019;t know everything either. When he left me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;after, he gave me to a Dwarf. Bl�d was his name. I was a reward, a toy, but he said something to the Dwarf: he said I was to be killed, <i>and that there was a reason.</i>&#x201d; There was cold resolution in her voice. &#x201c;I will bear this child because I am alive when he wished me dead&#x2014;the child is random, it is outside his purposes.&#x201d;</p><p>He was silent a long time. Then, &#x201c;But so are you, in and of yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Her laugh was a brutal sound. &#x201c;And how am I, in and of myself, to answer him? I am going to have a son, Paul, and he will be my answer.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;There is too much evil in this, and only to prove a point already proven.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nonetheless,&#x201d; said Jennifer.</p><p>After a moment his mouth crooked sideways. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t press you on it, then. I came for you, not him. Kim&#x2019;s already dreamt his name, anyhow.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes flashed. &#x201c;Paul, understand me. I would do what I am doing whatever Kim said. Whatever she happened to dream. And I will name him as I choose!&#x201d;</p><p>He was smiling, improbably. &#x201c;Stick around and do that then. Stay with us, Jen. We need you back.&#x201d; Only when he spoke did she realize what she&#x2019;d said. He&#x2019;d tricked her, she decided, had goaded her quite deliberately into something unintended. But she couldn&#x2019;t, for some reason, feel angry. Had this first tenuous spar he&#x2019;d thrown across to her been a little firmer she might, in fact, have smiled.</p><p>Paul stood up. &#x201c;There is an exhibition of Japanese prints at the Art Gallery. Would you like to see it with me?&#x201d;</p><p>For a long time she rocked in the chair, looking up at him. He was dark-haired, slight, still frail-seeming, though not so much as last spring.</p><p>&#x201c;What was the dog&#x2019;s name?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I wish I did.&#x201d;</p><p>After another moment she rose, put on her coat, and took her first careful step on the first bridge.</p><p>Dark seed of a dark god, Paul was thinking, as he tried to simulate an interest in nineteenth-century prints from Kyoto and Osaka. Cranes, twisted trees, elegant ladies with long pins in their hair.</p><p>The lady beside him wasn&#x2019;t talking a great deal, but she was there in the gallery, and it was not a small grace. He remembered the crumpled figure she had been seven months before, when Kim had brought them desperately from Fionavar with the wild, blazing power of the Baelrath.</p><p>This was Kim&#x2019;s power, he knew: the Warstone and the dreams in which she walked at night, white-haired as Ysanne had been, two souls within her, and knowledge of two worlds. It had to be a difficult thing. <i>The price of power</i>, he remembered Ailell the High King telling him, the night they played their game of ta&#x2019;bael. The night that had been overture to the three nights that became his own hard, hardest thing. The gateway to whatever he now was, Lord of the Summer Tree.</p><p>Whatever he now was. They had moved into the twentieth century now: more cranes, long, narrow mountain scenes, low boats riding on wide rivers.</p><p>&#x201c;The themes don&#x2019;t change much,&#x201d; Jennifer said.</p><p>&#x201c;Not much.&#x201d;</p><p>He had been sent back, he was M�rnir&#x2019;s response, but he had no ring with which to burn, no dreams down which to track the secrets of the Tapestry, not even a horn such as Dave had found, no skylore like Loren, or crown like Aileron; not even&#x2014;though he felt a chill at the thought&#x2014;a child within him like the woman at his side.</p><p>And yet. There had been ravens at his shoulder in the branches of the Tree: Thought and Memory were their names. There had been a figure in the clearing, hard to see, but he had seen horns on its head and seen it bow to him. There had been the white mist rising up through him to the sky in which a red moon sailed on new moon night. There had been rain. And then the God.</p><p>And there was still the God. At night, sometimes, he could feel the tacit presence, immense, in the rush and slide of his blood, the muffled thunder of his human heart.</p><p>Was he a symbol only? A manifestation of what he had been telling Jennifer: the presence of opposition to the workings of the Unraveller? There were worse roles, he supposed. It gave him a part to play in what was to come, but something within&#x2014;and there was a god within him&#x2014;said that there was more. <i>No man shall be Lord of the Summer Tree who has not twice been born</i>, Jaelle had said to him in the sanctuary.</p><p>He was more than symbol. The waiting to learn what, and how, seemed to be part of the price.</p><p>Almost at the end now. They stopped in front of a large print of a river scene: boats being poled along, others unloading at a crowded dock; there were woods on the far side of the stream, snowcapped mountains beyond. It was badly hung, though; he could see people behind them reflected in the glass, two students, the sleepy gu...</p></p><h2>The Memory of All That: Love and Politics in New York, Hollywood, and Paris</h2><p>The Academy Award-nominated actress and wife of Gene Kelly traces her life from her experiences as a teenage dancer in the 1930s, to a child bride of a Hollywood star, to an accomplished actress in Europe, describing her mentorship and marriage to Kelly, her New York education, her rejection of Hollywood fashions, and her status as a blacklisted actress. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Betsy Blair was born in Cliffside Park, New Jersey. She was a child model, became a chorus dancer at fifteen, and appeared on Broadway in Panama Hattie and William Saroyan&#x2019;s <i>The Beautiful People</i>. She was married to Gene Kelly for sixteen years and appeared in such plays as Tennessee Williams&#x2019;s <i>The Glass Menagerie</i>, as well as <i>Sabrina Fair</i> and <i>The Rainmaker</i>. She appeared in many motion pictures, including <i>A Double Life</i>, <i>Kind Lady</i>, <i>The Snakepit</i>, and <i>Marty</i>, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award. Betsy Blair lives in London.1<br><br>I can't claim it was love at first sight-not even from my side.<br><br>Billy Rose's nightclub, the Diamond Horseshoe, was in the basement of the Edison Hotel in New York, on Forty-seventh Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. The lobby, with its coffee shop, newspaper kiosk, shoe shine stand, and a cashiers' cage, was a bit dingy. A busboy showed me the staircase down to the nightclub.<br><br>I had been sixteen years old for three weeks. I was all dressed up in a lavender four-gore flared skirt made by my mother, a polka-dot blouse, a hand-me-down fingertip-length gray-squirrel coat, a pillbox hat with violets, and my one pair of high heels.<br><br>I had no strategy, no plan for my life beyond this audition and college in the fall. And, of course, I had my dream. Someday I would be a great actress, Eleanora Duse, Katherine Cornell, Helen Hayes. Or would I be a movie star-Ginger Rogers, Margaret Sullavan, Greta Garbo? No, not Garbo-I was from New Jersey.<br><br>That day I felt completely sure of myself. After all, I'd had a postcard addressed to me personally from Billy Rose himself, inviting me to this call for dancers. Down the stairs I went into another world.<br><br>The Diamond Horseshoe was luxurious. Near the entrance across the whole width of the room was a Gay Nineties-type bar, brass railed and mirrored. The walls were red velvet. There were crystal chandeliers. At the far end was the proscenium stage, with a horseshoe-shaped runway coming out of it. The inside of the horseshoe was lowered between shows to become the dance floor. Tables for about four hundred people surrounded the runway.<br><br>There was no one there except a young man. I took him for another bellboy or busboy. He seemed to be repositioning some of the tables and chairs.<br><br>"Excuse me. Is this where the call for dancers is?"<br><br>"Yes-but I think you'll find it's tomorrow."<br><br>"Oh no," I said. "I have a personal card from Mr. Billy Rose."<br><br>"Even so," he grinned at me, "it's tomorrow." He's fresh, I thought, as I fished in my pocketbook and took out the card. "Today's the tenth, isn't it?"<br><br>"Come back tomorrow. Today's the ninth." He was still grinning.<br><br>"Thank you," I said, as if to an underling. "I will."<br><br>He called after me, "Are you a dancer?"<br><br>I looked back and deigned to say, "Yes."<br><br>"Are you a good dancer?"<br><br>At that I stopped. "Very," I said, turned on my heel and left.<br><br>The scene the next day was entirely different. Six hundred girls had had cards from Mr. Rose. We'd all been invited personally. The stage manager and four assistants corralled us into groups of twenty. There was a work light on the stage, an upright piano and a trestle table with five chairs, a thermos of coffee, pitchers of water, ashtrays, pads, and pencils. At noon they arrived. The stage manager introduced them: "the director, John Murray Anderson" (white-haired, tough, and sharp-looking); "our designer, Raoul Pene du Bois" (a tall, refined, and delicate man); "Billy Rose himself" (short, with slick black hair, his stubby body encased in a very expensive suit with matching silk polka-dot tie and pocket handkerchief-Rose radiated energy and power, which made him attractive); and then "Gene Kelly, our choreographer." He was wearing an open-necked white shirt, a dark long-sleeved sweater, dark trousers, and moccasins. He seemed to be balanced on the balls of his feet, ready to spring like a cat. The combination of sensitive Irish face and slim muscular body was spectacular enough, but he was also the only one at that table who looked at us as individuals. And he was my "busboy"-the one I had told that I was a very good dancer. I felt the blush begin in the pit of my stomach. When I happened to catch his eye, he grinned at me again.<br><br>When my group lined up onstage, I was still blushing. We made a full turn in place as instructed, and then waited to be chosen. It was very quick. Five or six from each group were sent to the dressing room to put on rehearsal clothes. Then another lineup. By one-thirty, we were down to forty girls and I was still there. We broke until two-fifteen-lunch if we wanted it. I wasn't hungry.<br><br>Now the real audition began.<br><br>We would each step forward and give our name and our credits. The rehearsal pianist sat ready to play the traditional "Bye Bye Blues" forty times. The first eight bars were for the "time-step," then for the rest of the chorus we each did an original routine.<br><br>And then we waited.<br><br>Gene told me months later how it went.<br><br>They were hiring twelve dancers plus an understudy. Seven girls were on all four lists. I was on only two of them-Gene's and Raoul Pene du Bois's. The stage manager nixed me: "She's got no tits-she looks twelve years old." Billy Rose said, "Don't mention ages-yeah, no tits, but she has got the long stems." His chorus line was advertised as "Billy Rose's Long Stemmed American Beauties," so the legs were important to him. Gene fought for me. He said I could dance, and he needed some good dancers. Raoul murmured something about "a small-town Botticelli"-and Billy decided in my favor. He was into Art.<br><br>It was thirty-five dollars a week and a contract to be signed. They said, "If anyone is worried about signing, get your father or somebody to sign it for you," which meant, "We don't want to know if you're under eighteen." I was the only sixteen-year-old, but there were two others who were seventeen. We all signed our own contracts.<br><br>When I got home and told my mother about it all, she noticed that I mentioned Mr. Kelly a zillion times. "He told us to call him Gene." "He didn't say anything special to me, but he smiled at me once. I think he forgave me for thinking he was a busboy." "He said he was going to work us hard." (He actually said "work your butts off," but I couldn't tell my mother that-she'd once washed my mouth out with soap for calling a boy in school a "guy.") "He was so nice and friendly." "He was handsome." "He seemed serious-he plans to do some really good numbers with us-like in a musical on Broadway." Etcetera, etcetera.<br><br>Throughout the four weeks of rehearsal, I was walking, floating, dancing on air. I changed my clothes at lunchtime, clean white shorts and cotton top twice a day. My mother washed and ironed them every night. If Gene wanted to try out a step, I was always right there. I guess it was obvious to everyone but Gene and me that I was besotted. He was too busy working, and I was too innocent. I had no idea why I felt so happy.<br><br>Gene had come to New York from his hometown of Pittsburgh a year and a half earlier. He immediately got a part on Broadway as a specialty dancer in Leave It to Me, a Cole Porter musical starring Mary Martin and William Gaxton. Then he played the hoofer in William Saroyan's The Time of Your Life. He got wonderful reviews. The theater world recognized that someone special had appeared.<br><br>Those jobs paid the rent for his room with bath and kitchenette at the Woodward Hotel on Fifty-fifth Street and Broadway. But he wasn't satisfied; his creative energy and drive were gigantic.<br><br>His friends were other ambitious young actors, writers, and directors. Their group was intellectual and left-wing. Among them was our rehearsal pianist, Dick Dwenger. He was a playwright and Gene's best friend, blond and slight with glasses. He had a quiet authority and wit about him, and he played the piano.<br><br>Because Dick was a hungry young playwright, Gene got him the gig playing for our rehearsals. They explained to me later that it was also to keep an eye on Gene. It was Gene's first job as choreographer. Du Bois and Anderson were the big time, very experienced and brilliant. Gene knew what they could do and wanted to learn from them. But he also wanted to make his contribution. He was already aware of what that could be. He wanted to bring guts into dancing, to relate it to everyday life and bring it to the man and woman on the street, to people who didn't go to the ballet or the opera. Dick was to keep him from being dazzled, to remind him, if necessary, of his goals.<br><br>For this show, Gene planned a football number, and a schoolyard scene with identifiable characters: a boy, a girl, a bookworm, and a bully. (Naturally, we also had the almost obligatory cancan and South American numbers.) Well, he didn't win the "schoolyard battle." Billy Rose said, "They don't come to the Diamond Horseshoe to see a fucking ballet."<br><br>But the football number was in, and I was chosen by Mr. du Bois to model his design for it. Each costume was made up for one dancer first, to try it out for freedom of movement. There was a gold cloth helmet, a very broad-shouldered, very short-just to cover the nipples-gold leather cape over a flesh-colored net bra, bare midriff, gold latex pants to just below the knee, and gold lace-up boots.<br><br>In my general euphoria, I felt pretty good in it. But John Murray Anderson turned it ugly. It wasn't my first exposure to his vicious humor, nor was it to be my last. He'd nicknamed me "Teacher's Pet." I didn't mind that; in fact, I rather liked it. But for some reason, I was his chosen scapegoat. (I've since observed that a great many directors seem to need one.) I tossed my head a bit when I danced, and in the end of the second week of rehearsal, he stopped a number and called me out of the line: "Teacher's Pet, come here. Your head was bobbing like a cork in the ocean again. Kneel down in front of me and apologize." I was terrified and rebellious. But mainly I didn't want to cry. I took a deep breath, stepped forward, and went down on one knee. With a sweeping gesture like a medieval courtier I said, "I'm sorry, Sire."

In the later 1920s and 1930s, whole studios were established, notably in France and the United States, to serve the needs of a design- and style-conscious middle class intent on showing off its newly refined taste for things modern and exotic: the richly lacquered screen, the tubular steel chair, the vivid geometric carpet. Art Deco Interiors documents this flourishing of design ingenuity in Europe and America. Using contemporary photographs and illustrations of interiors, juxtaposed with modern photographs of individual pieces, it traces the stylistic evolution and dominant motifs of Deco. Patricia Bayer illustrates the triumph of the 1925 exhibition and the establishment of the pure high style of the leading Paris ensembliers, and assesses the tremendous growth of jazzy, Streamline Moderne offshoots in the United States. Major chapters are devoted to large-scale designs for ocean liners, cinemas, theaters, offices, and hotels, and to the revival in the 1970s and 1980s of Deco as a decorative style.</p><p>Patricia Bayer is an art historian who has written extensively on Art Deco design and architecture.

Though his name may be familiar to all of us, his work has been habitually detested and forced into obscurity. Not only was his theatrical realism unfashionable in his time, but his sacrilegious subject matter and use of lower class models were violently scorned.<br> <br> Caravaggio&#x2019;s great work had the misfortune of enduring centuries of disrepute. It wasn&#x2019;t until the end of the 19th century that he was rediscovered and, quite posthumously, deemed a great master. He is now considered the most important painter of the early Baroque period; without him there would have been no Ribera, Zurbar�n, Vel�zquez, Vermeer or Georges de la Tour. Franz Hals, Rembrandt, Delacroix, and Manet would have been different.<br> <br> In this new book you&#x2019;ll find over 50 of Caravaggio&#x2019;s best paintings; we think you&#x2019;ll agree that he was a genius beyond his time. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>Gilles N�ret (1933&#x2013;2005) was an art historian, journalist, writer and museum correspondent.

She builds an entertaining and persuasive case, using as examples everything from its unfathomable codes of conduct to its disciplined fashion sense. When a bemused Reed once commented on the cross-dressing get-ups of an upstanding community member, her austere grandfather said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been wearing them lately. Now come on.&#x201d; A friend of her aunt&#x2019;s merely said, &#x201c;I wonder where he gets his shoes. I can&#x2019;t ever ?nd good-looking shoes in Nashville.&#x201d; <br><br>Southern food, of course, is an entire world apart: gumbo, grits, greens, okra, chess pie, Lady Baltimore cake, and Frito chili pie make memorable appearances in Reed&#x2019;s stories, which will amuse, delight, and even explain a thing or two to baffed Yankees everywhere.</p><p>&#x201c;Not since Eudora Welty has anybody captured in such sophisticated, often mordant prose the brave, gracious, perverse, reckless, God-fearing Southern soul like Julia reed. Whether she&#x2019;s holding forth on fried chicken and catfish, guns, booze, cockfights, pestilence, or Southern womanhood, Reed loads both barrels and never misses the target. As a Carolina Tarheel, I rejoiced, cringed, marveled, and laughed myself sick at Reed&#x2019;s outrageous tales and savvy insights, and I defy anybody&#x2013;Southerner and Yankee alike&#x2013;to come up for are after reading the first chapter.&#x201d; &#x2013;<b>James Villas</b>, author of <b>Between Bites</b> <b>and My Mother's Southern Kitchen</b><br><br>"This is a wise and tender book.

She graduated from Vassar College with honorsand received a Masters in Library Science from the CarnegieInstitute of Technology. After working as a children'slibrarian, she was a professor at the Graduate School ofLibrary and Information Sciences of the University ofPittsburgh. Margaret wrote numerous award-winning books forchildren. A majority of her work is inspired fromfolktales and historical figures.Grade 2-6-Hodges does a fine job of adapting and retelling the saint's story from William Caxton's 15th-century Golden Legend, acknowledging that these tales were not meant to be historical. Offero has a desire to serve the greatest king in the world. He serves a variety of masters, including a monarch and a cruel devil, believing each is the greatest ruler, until the sign of a cross causes the devil to flee, and Offero looks for Christ. A hermit tells him that he should take travelers across the river to find Christ, and one night he carries a young boy who becomes so heavy that he feels like the world is on his shoulders. The child is Christ, carrying the burdens of the world. Changing the man's name to Christopher, which means the Christ-bearer, Christ sends him back to the river to continue helping travelers. Hodges's style is fluid and has the cadence and rhythm of an experienced storyteller. The text is well illustrated by Watson's sometimes complex, full-page paintings done in oils on acrylic. While the figures are realistic, the backgrounds are mysterious and impressionistic, dark and somewhat foreboding until after the encounter with Christ, when they become infused with light. As she did in St. Jerome and the Lion (Orchard, 1991; o.p.), Hodges brings the story to life for young readers.<br><i>Jane G. Connor, South Carolina State Library, Columbia</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art</h2><p>The tragic story of the talented painter Jean-Michel Basquiat details his turbulent childhood, explosive dealings with the elite art world, relationships with such figures as Andy Warhol and Madonna, and rise to fame, which led to his death from a drug overdose at the age of twenty-seven. 12,000 first printing.</p><p>This minutely reported book is as much a portrait of the frenzied, prodigal New York art world of the 1980s as it is a biography of Jean-Michel Basquiat, who died of a drug overdose at age 27 in 1988. Basquiat, one of very few African American artists to acquire an international reputation, left a thick web of dealers, collectors, friends, lovers, paintings, drawings, and used syringes behind him. Author Phoebe Hoban seems to have unblinkingly interviewed or examined them all. While she duly registers Basquiat's sad childhood, with his unstable Puerto Rican mother and punishing Haitian father, she doesn't make much of the deeper veins of sorrow and self-destruction that may have motivated the artist and informed his art. Rather, she allows his celebrity, which whisked him from street urchin to art star, to be the central trajectory of this story. The Warhol prot�g� would probably approve, as he was the primary obliterator of his own psychological depths, throwing away his short, phenomenally productive life in the edgy club and drug scene of downtown Manhattan. The miracle is that Basquiat was so good, and so serious, an artist, surrounded as he was by hype and cash. Hoban's book is a fluid, intricate, authoritative dissection of a time, a place, and--almost--a person. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i>Phoebe Hoban is a New York-based journalist.

These four novels, each a miniature masterpiece, illustrate her development over four decades. Despite the seriousness of their themes, all four are fantastic comedies of manners, bristling with wit.<br>Spark's most celebrated novel, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, tells the story of a charismatic schoolteacher's catastrophic effect on her pupils. THE GIRLS OF SLENDER MEANS" is a beautifully drawn portrait of young women living in a hostel in London in the giddy postwar days of 1945. THE DRIVER'S SEAT follows the final haunted hours of a woman descending into madness. And THE ONLY PROBLEM is a witty fable about suffering that brings the Book of Job to bear on contemporary terrorism. <br>All four novels give evidence of one of the most original and unmistakable voices in contemporary fiction. Characters are vividly etched in a few words; earth-shaking events are lightly touched on. Yet underneath the glittering surface there is an obsessive probing of metaphysical questions: the meaning of good and evil, the need for salvation, the search for significance.Muriel Spark&#39;s many novels include Memento Mori, The Girls of Slender Means, A Far Cry From Kensington, The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie (adapted for film and theatre), Aiding And Abetting and her final novel, The Finishing School.

Victor Joyce, a local college professor infamous both for his ambition and extracurricular activities, had been drinking heavily the night of the crash. But a witness who passed by the wreck insists that the victim was not dead, just unconscious. Rabbi Small learns that quite a number of &#34;innocent&#34; citizens drove down the seldom-used road on that rainy night. Any one of them could have had it in for the not-so-revered professor . . .Politics--religious and academic--inform this welcome encore from the always entertaining Kemelman ( Conversations with Rabbi Small ), whose previous Rabbi Small mysteries have won him a legion of fans. Twenty-five years after coming to the Boston suburb of Barnard's Crossing, Rabbi David Small is considering retirement. But before he can get so much as one foot out of the pulpit, a local college professor dies in a car accident and the weary clergyman finds himself once again drawn from his own everyday concerns into more serious matters. A known gigolo, the professor had recently wed the unattractive niece of a college benefactor in a bid to ensure his tenure. At first the authorities ascribe his death to drunk driving, but as the tawdry details of the man's life become known, police chief Hugh Lanigan suspects foul play and enlists the help of his old friend and partner in detection, Rabbi Small. Moving between scenes at the synagogue with its ever-squabbling board of directors and the fiercely competitive tenure-track tableaux at the college, the narrative never flags as clues and suspects accumulate. Lively dialogue, dry wit and wonderfully authentic detail make this a sure winner. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Fall of Heaven: The Pahlavis and the Final Days of Imperial Iran</h2><p><p><b>An immersive, gripping account of the rise and fall of Iran's glamorous Pahlavi dynasty, written with the cooperation of the late Shah's widow, Empress Farah, Iranian revolutionaries and US officials from the Carter administration</b></p><p>In this remarkably human portrait of one of the twentieth century's most complicated personalities, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Andrew Scott Cooper traces the Shah's life from childhood through his ascension to the throne in 1941. He draws the turbulence of the post-war era during which the Shah survived assassination attempts and coup plots to build a modern, pro-Western state and launch Iran onto the world stage as one of the world's top five powers. Readers get the story of the Shah's political career alongside the story of his courtship and marriage to Farah Diba, who became a power in her own right, the beloved family they created, and an exclusive look at life inside the palace during the Iranian Revolution. Cooper's investigative account ultimately delivers the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty through the eyes of those who were there: leading Iranian revolutionaries; President Jimmy Carter and White House officials; US Ambassador William Sullivan and his staff in the American embassy in Tehran; American families caught up in the drama; even Empress Farah herself, and the rest of the Iranian Imperial family. Intimate and sweeping at once, <i>The Fall of Heaven</i> recreates in stunning detail the dramatic and final days of one of the world's most legendary ruling families, the unseating of which helped set the stage for the current state of the Middle East.</p></p><p><b>Andrew Scott Cooper</b> is the author of <i>The Oil Kings: How the U.S., Iran and Saudi Arabia Changed the Balance of Power in the Middle East,</i> and an adjunct assistant professor at Columbia University.

Most of us have known someone who has served our country in the armed forces. I've often listened as men have talked about their experiences and wondered what it felt like for them to face severe enemy threat.</p> <p> It doesn't take long to realize that when you are in the heat of the battle, the enemy will do anything to bring you down in defeat. This is especially true on physical battlefields, but also on the spiritual front lines where Satan lurks--seeking to destroy us so we will not serve God or do His will.</p> <p> If you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior, then you need to know that the enemy will stop at nothing to prevent you from knowing God and living for Jesus Christ. He does this by creating a major conflict across the landscape of your life. Extreme as it may seem, Satan is convinced that if he can accomplish his wretched goals, you will become discouraged and fearful, and you will want to give up. A disarmed, discouraged believer who has fallen into the dust of defeat, suffocated by guilt and shame, is no threat to him. Be aware: he does not hesitate to use extreme tactics of warfare--ones that are specifically designed to separate you from God and His blessings, as well as the love and respect of friends and family.</p> <p> THE TRUTH CONCERNING LANDMINES</p> <p> Many people mistakenly think that Satan uses obvious means to draw us off course. However, his most devastating weapons of warfare are barely visible. They lay hidden below the surface of our spiritual landscape. Yet when we move in their direction, they explode beneath us, inflicting deep heartache, sorrow, and brokenness. Sometimes the injury seems beyond repair, but it never is when God is involved.</p> <p> Over the past few years, we have learned about the powerful brute force of one of the most devastating weapons of warfare--a landmine. A short time ago, many of us never would have thought to list this device as one of the most destructive on a battlefield, but it is. When a veteran speaks of going to war, our minds immediately fill with images of agile aircraft flying at top speed, combat troops outfitted with the latest technology for battle, and tanks--not the kind that once rolled noisily over the landscape of foreign countries, but fastmoving fortresses built to penetrate enemy lines and conquer advancing adversaries.</p> <p> It is hard to imagine a single piece of metal, which may be no larger than two feet by two feet, having the ability to destroy such military might, but this is exactly what a landmine does. It annihilates whatever is nearby, and the slightest pressure can detonate it.</p> <p> By the time a landmine is uncovered, it is usually too late to get out of the way.When I think about this, I am reminded why this weapon of warfare is so effective. Its stealthy appearance is sinister and deadly. Just as there are physical landmines placed along pathways and roadsides and out in open fields, Satan strategically places landmines in the path of every believer. There is no such thing as a clear, straight path without landmines. Each day, we face the threat of stepping on a spiritual landmine and suffering the sorrow and devastation this brings.</p> <p> When we step on one of the enemy's landmines, the explosion that follows usually has an adverse effect on our relationships with God and with others, as well as our personal testimony. It also alters the way we operate in life.We miss out on the joy of experiencing God's richest blessings. We need to make a clear distinction between the landmines on a real battlefield and the ones that Satan plants along our way. They explode beneath us as a result of our fallen world. Others are landmines that the enemy strategically places with an express desire to inflict deep harm on us as believers. If we are not sensitive to the Lord's warning, we can get off course and confront destruction.</p> <p> YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CASUALTY</p> <p> I have watched people deal with the landmines of life, and their experience ends in one of two ways: either there is spiritual victory and the person grows closer to the Lord, or he is tripped up by Satan's deception and begins a downward spiral that leads to feelings of regret, sorrow, anger, frustration, and--if left unchecked--depression. But you do not have to fall victim to Satan's ploys. Although physical landmines may be hard to spot, God will give you the ability to uncover and disarm the spiritual landmines the enemy has laid across your path. You may feel as though you are standing in a minefield and you do not know which way to turn. I want to assure you that God knows. He has a plan for your rescue. No matter how great the temptation, you can take back any spiritual ground you have given to the enemy and reclaim your rightful position as a child of God.</p> <p> Peter admonished us to "be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour" (1 Peter 5:8). The apostle Paul reminded us that "it was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery" (Gal. 5:1). By that he meant being bound by anything that would prevent us from being all that God has planned for us to be. He went on to say, "You were called to freedom . . . do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another" (v. 13).</p> <p> How do you detect the deadly landmines Satan sets along your roadways, out in open fields where you like to walk, and in hidden locations that you may seldom think of frequenting? My prayer is that as you read this book, God will show you how to uncover and then protect yourself from the enemy's destructive weapons, such as pride, jealousy, feelings of insecurity, sexual sin, disappointment, unforgiveness, compromise, and more. Throughout this study, you also will be given key principles that can help you discover how to live a victorious Christian life without compromising what you know God has given you to do.</p> <p> Jesus told His disciples, "If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine; and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free" (John 8:31-32). The one thing that exposes, unearths, and disarms any landmine left in the path of a believer is truth--God's truth. When we can practice the principles written in His Word, we experience true freedom from sin, shame, and guilt. This is my prayer for you and all who read this book--that you will learn how to live free of sin's entanglement and reach your full potential as a child of God.</p></p><h2>Horns in High Country</h2><p>The author describes his adventures in the North American wilderness observing mountain sheep and goats and their ways of life</p><p></p><h2>Paul: A Novel</h2><p>Journey with Saul of Tarsus from Jerusalem&#39;s temple and the martyrdom of Stephen to a transforming encounter with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus - then beyond to a waiting world. It is a world of bustling marketplaces filled with the smell of animals and the cry of merchants ... faces, cultures, and traditions as diverse as the varied landscape ... and human character and passions playing out in city streets, in corridors of power, and in homes of the humble. Here, in the shadow of imperial Rome, the early church is unfolding its vigorous bud. And the man Saul, whom the Gentiles know as Paul, will spread its seed, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to the ends of the known world.</p><p>Saul of Tarsus, the impassioned rabbi and persecutor of Christians, had a Damascus road experience that changed his life and helped shape the future of the world. As Paul, writer of some of the meatiest chunks of the New Testament and zealous missionary to the Gentiles, he became one of the most controversial figures in history.<p> Yet what do we know about the man, other than what's in the letters that have fashioned the Christian church for 2,000 years? Unless you are a theologian or historian, the answer probably is very little--until now. Walter Wangerin, the highly acclaimed scholar and writer, has breathed new life into this fiery, enigmatic, and passionate creature in what should be celebrated as a seriously good work of literature.</p><p> The novel, which combines expert knowledge and prophetic imagination, charts the first exhilarating and dangerous years of the church after the death of Christ. It is seen through the eyes of the witnesses--Priscilla, who meets Paul in Corinth; Barnabus, Timothy, and Titus, his companions; James and Simon Peter, the "pillar" of the first Christians; and Seneca, the great Roman writer, statesman, and adviser to Nero.</p><p> Wangerin serves up a feast of color and detail that brings the first century--and, even more impressively, the Bible--alive. Whatever your religious persuasion, this book serves as a fine companion to the one of the greatest yet most puzzling stories ever told. <i>--Brian Draper, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Walter Wangerin Jr. first came to prominence as the award-winning author of The Book of the Dun Cow.

Entrancing in its lyricism, <i>In Sunlight and in Shadow</i> so powerfully draws you into New York at the dawn of the modern age that, as in a vivid dream, you will not want to leave.<br></p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Mark Helprin</b></p> <p><strong>Q. <i>In Sunlight and In Shadow</i> has been likened to both your <i>Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i> and <i>A Soldier of the Great War</i>. What do you say to that?</strong></p> <p>A. When I wrote <i>Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i>, I&#x2019;d often walk ten or twenty miles a day through New York, taking in overwhelming rafts of imagery, sounds, views. And when I wasn&#x2019;t doing that, I virtually lived at The New York Historical Society, just as I had jeopardized my freshman year in college by sitting on the floor of the stacks at the New York section, mesmerized by one book after another.</p> <p>The result of these obsessions was to live in the world of New York circa 1900 as if I were really there, as if it were still bustling invisibly right where it had been, and I could see and feel it. The book opens with, &#x201c;I have been to another world, and come back. Listen to me.&#x201d;</p> <p>With <i>In Sunlight and In Shadow</i>, the effect is perhaps stronger, and, for me, easier. It takes place not in a world I had to seek but one &#x2013; New York in the 40s &#x2013; into which I was born. The density and accuracy of the images, the onrush of memory, the stunning recollections of sound, speech, song, dress, all came easily. The people in <i>In Sunlight and In Shadow</i> are, with great poetic liberty, people I knew and/or loved &#x2013; even the gangsters, the financiers, the actresses, intellectuals, soldiers, and factory workers.</p> <p>When I finished <i>A Soldier of the Great War</i>, I gave it to several Italians to see if the pitch was correct, but with In Sunlight and In Shadow I didn&#x2019;t have to do that, because there is nothing I know better. The book is like <i>Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i> in that I have made it as obsessively truthful and beautiful as I could, in the hope that a reader may feel that he is in the book rather than where he is, and perhaps even wish to remain for a while, as in waking from a dream.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s unlike Winter&#x2019;s Tale and more like <i>A Soldier of the Great War</i> in that in it one doesn&#x2019;t depart from the texture of reality, as exceptional and intense as that reality may be. When my father read <i>Winter&#x2019;s Tale</i>, which I had dedicated to him shortly before he died, he said, now you&#x2019;ve got to write a book as enchanting as this but in which every element is possible in the real world in which we live. Then you would have something really marvelous.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve tried to do. Whether or not I&#x2019;ve succeeded is not for me to judge, but I can say that writing the book gave me the same feeling, persistently over time, and always strongly, as falling in love. I&#x2019;m not quite sure what that means except that it&#x2019;s great to have a job that you would do even if you weren&#x2019;t paid for it.</p>HMH hardcover 2012, previous ISBN: 978-0-547-81923-5</p><h2>Pollyanna Grows Up (Puffin Classics)</h2><p>Her crippled legs cured, Pollyanna takes her glad heart to cheer new friends in Boston before travelling to Europe with Aunt Polly and Dr chilton.

John Lukacs, author of <i>The Hitler of History</i>, explores this issue in <i>A Thread of Years</i>, an impressionist illustration of social history in the 20th century that focuses on the decline of honor and moral behavior in America. Lukacs's narrative falls somewhere between factual, tangible history and well-written romance, with a nod to the latter embodied in the brief fictional vignettes he uses to begin each chapter. The book moves chronologically from 1901 to 1969, presenting along the way a number of characters and scenarios Lukacs considers indicative of their respective eras. His purpose is to show that since 1969, Anglo-American civilization and ideals have fallen dramatically. <p> Lukacs is careful to back up his points, arguing that the decline of imperialist Britain's influence, the rise of immigration, and the slow erosion of religion, along with an apathetic elite class's refusal to give society more support, have all contributed to the decline of morals over the course of this century. This highly original study is more a romantic romp through the last century than a concise analytical account, yet Lukacs has created a fascinating retrospective portrait of society, one that will have readers pondering the direction of contemporary American morals.</p><b>John Lukacs</b> was professor of history at Chestnut Hill College, Philadelphia, until his recent retirement and has been visiting professor at many universities.

Other times the loop replayed itself, an earworm, a melody my memory couldn&#x2019;t cut loose.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not in my personality to recall moments of assurance with much clarity. What I tend to recall vividly are my doubts and my fears. That therapy loop earned the replays because it was the session when my doubts and my fears began to crystallize, when I went from thinking that I might be in over my therapeutic head to wondering what the hell I might have gotten myself into with Dr. Alan Gregory.</p><p>Or as I called him, my patient.</p><br><br><p>My name is Delilah Mary Travis. My friends call me Lila.</p><p>Most of my patients call me Dr. Travis, or Delilah.</p><p>Alan Gregory called me Lila. But we weren&#x2019;t friends.</p><p>It was the third week of January. The session had been fitful. I felt no rhythm in his words.</p><p>As the end of our time approached I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what happened that morning. The day of the fire. The morning of the shooting. Moment by moment. You may think I know. You may wish I knew. You may want to proceed as though I know what you need me to know. But I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t reply. That happened frequently with us.</p><p>During Alan&#x2019;s previous visit I&#x2019;d asked him why he&#x2019;d picked me to be his therapist. He said it was because he wanted a therapist he didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;he knew almost everybody in Boulder&#x2014;and because someone he trusted had once said good things about my work. I&#x2019;d asked him why he didn&#x2019;t go to Denver; there had to be therapists there he didn&#x2019;t know. He said it was too much for him then. An almost three-hour round-trip? He said he couldn&#x2019;t do it.</p><p>I began to think he&#x2019;d been less than honest. I began to believe he chose me because I was inexperienced. He thought he could manipulate me.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;I imagine it will be tender for you, sharing the story. But at some point you will need to tell me those details.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood. His timing was impeccable; he rose within seconds of the precise forty-five-minute mark. As a therapist he had sat through a million forty-five-minute hours. After the first few thousand or so he&#x2019;d undoubtedly internalized the session interval.</p><p>I had not. My hours in the consultation chair were still in high triple-digits. The clock I relied upon was digital. It was not visible from his seat.</p><p>&#x201c;Who does, Lila?&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Know? What happened, I mean.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Who knows? You&#x2019;re going existential about that? You were there, I wasn&#x2019;t. If I had been there I would know what the hell happened.</i></p><p>I kept the rant to myself. I said, &#x201c;Are you unsure what happened that day?&#x201d;</p><p><i>No dissociation, please. I don&#x2019;t have the chops for fugue. Not your fugue. </i></p><p>His face adjusted into an expression I couldn&#x2019;t interpret. He had a few of those. Then he said, &#x201c;Am I &#x2018;sure&#x2019;? A lot of certainty is squeezed into that syllable. Certainty is elusive for me. Death? Certain. Everything else? Uncertain.&#x201d;</p><p><i>God.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s part of what happened that morning that you don&#x2019;t know. That maybe no one else knows.&#x201d; He took a deep breath. &#x201c;My wife was in my office to caution me about a development in a case she was working. When she came to see me she didn&#x2019;t understand the implications of what she had learned. She thought she did, but she did not. She was being generous, maybe loving&#x2014;I go back and forth about that&#x2014;by warning me about legal action that was coming against someone I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Legal action?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Taking that person into custody. For questioning. Or arrest. Like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said. Why I thanked him I did not know.</p><p>&#x201c;I told her that if she were to start arresting people she would have to begin by arresting me.&#x201d;</p><p>I was disbelieving. I&#x2019;m sure I looked it. I said, &#x201c;You?&#x201d;</p><p>He said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s complicated. This may help: After Lauren told me what she was about to do, I knew the time had arrived to reveal some secrets I&#x2019;d been keeping from her. I did that&#x2014;I revealed some things I had done.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Things?&#x201d; <i>Jesus</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Acts.&#x201d;</p><p><i>That sure clears things up</i>. I said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re being vague.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Intentionally. I am revealing I have secrets, but I am not revealing those secrets.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Trust?&#x201d; I said. Not exactly a therapeutic reach on my part. It was like a meteorologist forecasting rain seconds after she opens her umbrella.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Lauren recognized the implications of what I told her. I knew she would, but I had hoped that my admission might alter the tilt of her heart. In my favor.&#x201d;</p><p>To him, his failure to trust me required no exploration. I felt it as a wound.</p><p>&#x201c;I was wrong,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Lauren was angry. Not understanding. All that my revelation changed for her that morning was her thinking about whom to arrest.&#x201d;</p><p>Alan Gregory was one of those people who confused me when he told me things intended to alleviate my confusion. By then that wasn&#x2019;t news for me.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;She was going to arrest you? When she was shot?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not at the beginning of her visit but, yes, by the end. When she was shot.&#x201d;</p><p>His shoulders fell. Some amount of tension disappeared from his temples and his jaw. He seemed relieved to have breached this wall with me. We made brief eye contact. The intimacy of it all stunned me. Part of me melted with his glance, as though for that instant alone our arteries shared the same pumping heart.</p><p>He shook his head, as though he were as amazed as I was. His breath was shallow. &#x201c;That morning? The fire up the street? Don&#x2019;t forget the fire.&#x201d;</p><p>My breathing was shallow, too. The mirroring was not intentional. No, I had not forgotten the fire.</p><p>In a way that I don&#x2019;t think I had ever felt before in my time as a therapist, I was aware that a patient was sharing a dangerous secret with me. Not just a sensitive truth&#x2014;that&#x2019;s routine&#x2014;but a dangerous one. Dangerous for him. And possibly dangerous for me.</p><p>Alan Gregory woke to foreboding every morning of his life. To help him I would need to understand his foreboding. Perhaps even to feel it.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;Could you please sit back down, Alan?&#x201d; If he considered me a peer he wouldn&#x2019;t put me in the position I was in. I knew that. I didn&#x2019;t like it.</p><p>&#x201c;Our time is up,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>I swallowed a sigh. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my call. This is my office. I am your therapist.&#x201d; I shouldn&#x2019;t have had to remind him of that. We&#x2019;d work on that issue later. The list of what we would work on later was becoming unwieldy.</p><p>He nodded. But he remained standing. He seemed more paralyzed than defiant.</p><p>&#x201c;Your wife was about to have you arrested for what?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something serious,&#x201d; Alan said. &#x201c;A felony. I can&#x2019;t discuss it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><p>He sat down. &#x201c;I will tell you what I told Lauren that morning: my caution has to do with clean hands.&#x201d; He looked at his hands as though he couldn&#x2019;t not look at his hands.</p><p>With monumental self-control I managed not to look at my hands. I was aware that his wife was shot not too many moments after he told her whatever he told her that morning. Apparently about clean hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Yours?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Your clean hands?&#x201d;</p><p>He stood back up. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Yours.&#x201d;</p><p>That did it. I looked at my hands. I said, &#x201c;Sit, please.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t. Shit. &#x201c;She had a reason to arrest you? The felony?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Definitely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You say &#x2018;definitely&#x2019; yet you continue to be vague. You seem to be admitting . . . what, guilt? Yes? Are we talking about trust again? Right now? Between you and me?&#x201d;</p><p>Air escaped his nostrils in a little huff. &#x201c;Guilt? No question. Right and wrong. Morality? That&#x2019;s murky. Between us? Of course it&#x2019;s about trust.&#x201d;</p><p>He paused. I look back now and I wonder about that pause. I think he was telling me something. But I was missing it.</p><p>He tried to explain. &#x201c;Trust is not only an issue between you and me. It was there between my wife and me. Maybe it is there between my friend&#x2014;or friends&#x2014;and me. There is a lot on the line here beyond my mental health. Culpability. Survival. Freedom. All of those.&#x201d;</p><p>Before I could acknowledge that gravity, he refocused on the mundane. He said, &#x201c;We need to talk about your notes. Session notes, process notes, whatever. And supervision.&#x201d;</p><p>What? &#x201c;Please sit. If you don&#x2019;t I am going to have to stand.&#x201d; He sat. I said, &#x201c;Thank you. What about supervision? What about my notes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you being supervised on this case?&#x201d;</p><p>I had never before been asked that question. Few patients know that supervision&#x2014;oversight of a treatment by a senior practitioner&#x2014;exists as an option for their therapist. But Alan Gregory knew. He was one of those senior practitioners. In Boulder he was a supervisor.</p><p>&#x201c;This therapy?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;With you?&#x201d; He nodded. &#x201c;No. I am not being supervised.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you change your mind&#x2014;about supervision&#x2014;will you agree to inform me? I can&#x2019;t have what I tell you leave this room. Not even to a supervisor. Clean hands?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s irregular,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s essential. Without that assurance, I can&#x2019;t proceed. Won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I need to think about it. We can discuss it next time. What about my notes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would like you to make them sparse,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Short? Or, or lacking detail? What kind of sparse?&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded. Then he shook his head.</p><p>I made a <i>so WTF</i> face. If I&#x2019;d had a supervisor she would have been directing me to continue to work on maintaining a therapeutic expression. They all did.</p><p>He said, &#x201c;Lacking content. No names. No facts. No he-said, I-said. Process? Go to town. Whatever&#x2019;s helpful.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t show my clinical notes to anyone, Alan. Ever. You don&#x2019;t have to worry.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes were dismissive. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be here if I thought you would. I am concerned about people who would look at them without your consent.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt a chill. <i>Huh?</i> I looked at my hands again.</p><p>He said, &#x201c;You may not have experience with those people. I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said. With another patient, I would not have admitted that. Alan Gregory was not another patient.</p><p>&#x201c;Those people may know that I am coming to see you for therapy,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>It is typically no more a presence in my body than my liver, but my heart suddenly became an entity in my chest. <i>Bump bump. Bump bump.</i></p><p>I began to question things I should have questioned sooner. My mind reassembled fragments and pieces he had allowed to leak out along the way.</p><p><i>A wildfire. Arrest. A gun. Shots in the back. A witness. His partner. A felony. A little boy. Trust. A leg wound. A wife in ICU. A cabbist. </i></p><p><i>Oh shit. And . . . holy shit. The felony. Trust. Guilt?</i> I realized what he was admitting to me. I began to speak. My breath caught in my throat. I tried again.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;You had a motive? That morning? To shoot your wife, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you choose to stop treating me, I understand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I asked you a question,&#x201d; I said.</p><p><i>Bump bump. Bump bump.</i></p><p>He looked out the window. &#x201c;My request about your notes?&#x201d;</p><p><i>Jesus. Did you hear what I just asked you? </i>&#x201c;Uh, I will be careful. I will take a look at what I&#x2019;ve written. Next time we can talk about what I decide about shredding and starting over. Did&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Handwritten or digital?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Dictated? I hope you don&#x2019;t have them in the cloud.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Handwritten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you shred, it needs to be cross-shred, not strip-shred. Separate the confetti into piles. Dispose of the piles in different places. Or set the shreds on fire. Either works.&#x201d;</p><p>My patient wanted me to torch my notes. I added paranoia to his differential diagnosis. <i>Great. This is great. </i></p><p>&#x201c;Alan, did you have a motive to shoot your wife?&#x201d;</p><p>Without any further hesitation, he said, &#x201c;I did. That&#x2019;s the problem. At some point, they&#x2019;ll figure that out. He certainly will. And he won&#x2019;t let go. That, by the way, is the exact sort of thing that can&#x2019;t go in your notes.&#x201d;</p><p><i>He? </i></p><p><i>Bump bump. </i></p></p><h2>Breaking Into the Current: Boatwomen of the Grand Canyon</h2><p><b>In 1973, Marilyn Sayre gave up her job as a computer programmer</b> and became the first woman in twenty years to run a commercial boat through the Grand Canyon. Georgie White had been the first, back in the 1950s, but it took time before other women broke into guiding passengers down the Colorado River. This book profiles eleven of the first full-season Grand Canyon boatwomen, weaving together their various experiences in their own words.<br><br><i>Breaking Into the Current</i> is a story of romance between women and a place. Each woman tells a part of every Canyon boatwoman's story: when Marilyn Sayre talks about leaving the Canyon, when Ellen Tibbets speaks of crew camaraderie, or when Martha Clark recalls the thrill of white water, each tells how all were involved in the same romance.<br><br> All the boatwomen have stories to tell of how they first came to the Canyon and why they stayed. Some speak of how they balanced their passion for being in the Canyon against the frustration of working in a traditionally male-oriented occupation, where today women account for about fifteen percent of the Canyon's commercial river guides.<br><br> As river guides in love with the Canyon and their work, these women have followed their hearts.

But while keeping a keen eye on what's going on with old enemies, he notices that Russia's heavy bomber and tactical bomber bases are busier than ever. McLanahan tries to get his superiors to pay attention and is ignored.</p><p>Russian president General Anatoliy Gryzlov is determined to punish McLanahan and his fleet of robotic warplanes for a previous bombing of a Russian air base. To make his point, Gryzlov launches an all-out sneak attack on America -- unlike anything ever believed possible -- that devastates U.S. strategic air forces.</p><p>McLanahan has collected information that not only foretold the Russians' daring plan, but also gives him the data he needs to plan a counterstrike that could stop the Russian war machine dead in its tracks. But McLanahan is no longer in charge of Air Battle Force, his combat unit of the future, and the Russian sneak attack has left the embattled U.S. president with few options: retaliate with every weapon in his arsenal, even if it triggers a global thermonuclear war, agree to a cease-fire on Russia's terms ... or listen to a disgraced and discredited young bomber commander's long-shot plan of attack. To prevent a destructive stalemate, McLanahan may have to take matters into his own hands.</p></p><p><p>Former U.S. Air Force captain Dale Brown is the superstar author of 26 best-selling action-adventure &#x201c;techno-thriller&#x201d; novels: FLIGHT OF THE OLD DOG (1987), SILVER TOWER (1988), DAY OF THE CHEETAH (1989), HAMMERHEADS (1990), SKY MASTERS (1991), NIGHT OF THE HAWK (1992), CHAINS OF COMMAND (1993), STORMING HEAVEN (1994), SHADOWS OF STEEL (1996), FATAL TERRAIN (1997), THE TIN MAN (1998), BATTLE BORN, (1999), WARRIOR CLASS (2001), WINGS OF FIRE (2002), AIR BATTLE FORCE (2003), PLAN OF ATTACK (2004), ACT OF WAR (2005), EDGE OF BATTLE (2006), STRIKE FORCE (2007), SHADOW COMMAND (2008), ROGUE FORCES (2009), EXECUTIVE INTENT (2010), A TIME FOR PATRIOTS (2011), TIGER&#x2019;S CLAW (2012), STARFIRE (2014), and IRON WOLF (2015).

After a sneak attack on America that devastates all its strategic air forces, the nation has the choice to engage in a retaliatory global thermonuclear war or totally surrender on Russia's terms. William Dufris, a master at narration, skillfully makes this unthinkable threat plausible by creating unique voices for the gleefully energized 19-year-old reconnaissance technician; the determined Major McLanahan, stripped of his rank because of brilliant but unauthorized military action; and the relentlessly vengeful Russian President Gryzlov. Dufris's somber sincerity makes both the plot and the staggering array of advanced weaponry chillingly believable.

Approximately 200,000 years ago, as modern humans began to radiate out from their evolutionary birthplace in Africa, Neanderthals were already thriving in Europe&#x2015;descendants of a much earlier migration of the African genus <i>Homo</i>. But when modern humans eventually made their way to Europe 45,000 years ago, Neanderthals suddenly vanished. Ever since the first Neanderthal bones were identified in 1856, scientists have been vexed by the question, why did modern humans survive while their evolutionary cousins went extinct?<i></i></p><p><i>The Invaders </i>musters compelling evidence to show that the major factor in the Neanderthals&#x2019; demise was direct competition with newly arriving humans. Drawing on insights from the field of invasion biology, which predicts that the species ecologically closest to the invasive predator will face the greatest competition, Pat Shipman traces the devastating impact of a growing human population: reduction of Neanderthals&#x2019; geographic range, isolation into small groups, and loss of genetic diversity.</p><p>But modern humans were not the only invaders who competed with Neanderthals for big game. Shipman reveals fascinating confirmation of humans&#x2019; partnership with the first domesticated wolf-dogs soon after Neanderthals first began to disappear. This alliance between two predator species, she hypothesizes, made possible an unprecedented degree of success in hunting large Ice Age mammals&#x2015;a distinct and ultimately decisive advantage for humans over Neanderthals at a time when climate change made both groups vulnerable.</p></p><p>Pat Shipman is retired Adjunct Professor of Anthropology at Pennsylvania State University.Shipman [is] a genial and authoritative guide to a complex field... Shipman admits that scientists have yet to find genetic evidence that would prove her theory. Time will tell if she&#x2019;s right. For now, read this book for an engagingly comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving understanding of our own origins. (Toby Lester <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>Few if any readers of this lucid and compelling exposition will come away believing that the early modern Europeans were not deeply implicated in the Neanderthals&#x2019; disappearance. (Ian Tattersall <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>Are humans the ultimate invasive species? So contends anthropologist Pat Shipman&#x2015;and Neanderthals, she opines, were among our first victims. The relationship between <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i> is laid out cleanly, along with genetic and other evidence. Shipman posits provocatively that the deciding factor in the triumph of our ancestors was the domestication of wolves. Perhaps more troubling is the concept of early humans as invaders, rather than just another species finding its way. (Daniel Cressey <i>Nature</i>)<br><br>Since the discovery in the 19th century of Neanderthal remains, the cause of their extinction has arguably been the most compelling mystery in human evolution... <i>The Invaders</i> offers us the appealing prospect of an expert writing on her specialism and clearly having a great deal of fun doing so. Shipman builds an extremely compelling case for the role of <i>Homo sapiens</i> as an invasive species who arrived in Europe about 40,000 to 50,000 years ago and had an immediate impact on their new ecosystem. The Neanderthals were not the only victims... What makes Shipman&#x2019;s argument really stand out and offer a fresh perspective on the extinction of Neanderthals is the role that she gives to wolves in the process that led to the dominance of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. (Simon Underdown <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>According to a leading U.S. anthropologist, early dogs, bred from wolves, played a critical role in the modern human&#x2019;s takeover of Europe 40,000 years ago when we vanquished the Neanderthal locals... If Shipman is right, she will have solved one of evolution&#x2019;s most intriguing mysteries. (Robin McKie <i>The Observer</i>)<br><br>[A] cautious but compelling argument. (Brian Bethune <i>Maclean&#x2019;s</i>)<br><br>Provocative...Shipman&#x2019;s story makes for a dramatic and compelling narrative. (Mark Derr <i>Psychology Today</i>)<br><br>If you want to understand your own mind, read this remarkable and important book. Summoning new evidence, Pat Shipman shows how our coevolution with wolves contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals and further transformed us through the process of domesticating dogs. You will never look at Fido the same way again! (Nina G. Jablonski, Ph.D., Evan Pugh Professor of Anthropology, The Pennsylvania State University)<br><br>Why did the Neanderthals disappear? In a judicious and enthralling account, Shipman makes a compelling case that, as a truly invasive species, humans were the main cause. An original twist adds an accomplice to the scenario: An unexpectedly early prototype of man&#x2019;s best friend proved to be the Neanderthals&#x2019; worst enemy. (Robert D. Martin, A. Watson Armour III Curator of Biological Anthropology, The Field Museum, Chicago)<br><br>With her lucid synthesis of recent research, Shipman demonstrates that <i>Homo sapiens</i> was and is the very model of an invasive species.

That goal is achieved with a simple combination of cardiovascular exercise, resistance training, and flexibility work, combined with healthy eating. It's not a complicated plan. The people I work with want simplicity and results, and that's what you'll get here.<br><br>The plan I'm offering you is the same one I do myself. I work out with free weights, body weight, and resistance bands for 45 to 55 minutes 2 or 3 days a week at my home. Biceps curls, shoulder presses, lunges, situps, and pushups, plus a healthy dose of unusual exercises (you'll learn them here!), will challenge your balance, flexibility, core strength, and endurance. And ladies, speaking of pushups, for those of you who claim you can't do a standard pushup, I'll have you doing at least 10 before you finish this book! For cardio, I do 45 to 50 minutes 2 days a week, with as many different types of aerobic moves as I can cram into that time period. Yoga and stretching are musts for me, as is a hard-core plyometric interval routine that hammers my legs and glutes.<br><br>One of the main reasons why I stay fit is so that I can participate in the sports I love. Every Sunday morning, I head down to the original Muscle Beach near my home in Santa Monica, California, to meet up with a group of friends for an outdoor gymnastics session. We turn basic pullups, pushups, and situps into a much more intense combination of plyometric pullups, swing hand-stands, and 25-foot rope climbs (hands only and upside down), plus isometric core exercises. We even throw in a backflip or two.<br><br>On an occasional Wednesday night, I meet up with a group to go rock climbing. Every fall, I get together with ski buddies and work on ways to get our legs ready for the slopes. To me, there's nothing better than the great outdoors. The sports I enjoy most involve clean air, gorgeous views, and climbing up or ripping down pristine mountains. I also try to mix in other activities like in-line skating, table tennis, basketball, and mountain biking. When I'm at the beach or skiing, I'm one with my surroundings, happy as a clam and at peace with life. Participating in sports is a fun way to enjoy a healthy, active lifestyle. (Note to self for next book: Find out if clams are really happy. If an active lifestyle is the secret to happiness, consider using the phrase "happy as a hummingbird.")<br><br>And so, the program in this book is built around what I do--and what I know works, based on the results of thousands of men and women who have experienced amazing life changes using my programs. This program revolves around four key principles.<br><br>PRINCIPLE # 1: Individualization<br><br>A big reason why so many people have trouble staying on track is that they get caught up in the latest trend and don't focus on what they need as individuals. Your fitness choices should play to your "exercise personality." (We all have one, even if it has never been tapped into.) You may be someone who hates exercise, but you know you need to get moving. Gyms intimidate you. You think sweating is gross, and you've never had an athletic day in your life. Or maybe you're someone who exercises sporadically and the results have come at a snail's pace, if at all. Yes, I'm sure you have a ton of good excuses as to why your workouts have been hit or miss, but I can counter with a million more good reasons to be consistent--one of the most important being how you think and feel every day of the week, not just once in a while.<br><br>Maybe you're someone who loves to exercise, but you don't have the right formula. Chances are you've been wasting money on gym memberships and trainers who aren't giving you the results you've been looking for. You feel as if you've been doing everything "right," but you're frustrated by your lack of progress. I will show you how you can save tons of time, money, and energy by getting the best workouts possible right in your own home.<br><br>Perhaps the pleasures--and the benefits--have been lost on you because you've had nothing but negative experiences with working out and dieting. In my work as a trainer, I've found that many people exercise for the wrong reasons, or they don't do what's right for them, so they give up. Whether you're a busy mom with only minutes to spare or an athlete looking for peak performance, you will find something in this program to fit your needs and meet your goals. You see, exercise isn't a one-size-fits-all prescription. I design unique fitness programs for each person I train. Just pumping out generic workouts won't cut it. If I create a fitness program customized for a client's individual fitness preferences, physical condition, goals, and lifestyle, the odds are he or she will stay motivated and stick with it. Motivation is huge in helping you stay committed to this program so that positive long-term lifestyle changes can happen. When you choose the fitness program designed for your personality, you'll get excited about your potential.<br><br>PRINCIPLE #2: Periodization Training<br><br>We all need some excitement in our lives. When it comes to working out, we tend to appreciate familiarity and remain loyal to what works for us, but it's important to venture outside of our comfort zones and try different things that offer different benefits. The same principle applies to our relationships, work situations, and other choices in life. Well, I can't tell you how to heat up your love life (not in this book anyway), but in terms of exercise, if you've been training for a while and your progress has stopped or your workouts have gotten stale, I will certainly put some zing back into your training (which will make it trainzing?).<br><br>Anytime you present your body with a new physical challenge, it starts to respond in positive ways almost immediately. But when you do a physical task repeatedly, your body figures out a way to become more efficient and expends less energy. The result? The dreaded plateau. Your body will naturally stall as your fitness routine becomes second nature. This is what many people experience with traditional fitness programs: Your exercise sequence leads to a stalemate--no more growth, an increased risk of injuries, and less fat-burning.<br><br>Well, there will be no plateaus here--only continual, nonstop progress. Here's why: Each workout in this book incorporates some form of periodization training.<br><br>Periodization training doesn't sound like your typical workout term. It sounds more like a grammar rule you never bothered to memorize in fourth- grade English class. Put succinctly, periodization training is a protocol designed to avoid plateaus and produce continued gains. Your body will typically adjust to the specific stress you give it, but varying your regimen through periodization training forces it to adapt again and grow in the process. If you want a new or continued adaptation, you must do something new or continually add a different type of stress to your system.<br><br>Periodization training makes that happen by manipulating five fitness variables: volume, cycles, intensity, frequency, and active rest.<br><br>Volume is how much time you spend exercising aerobically or the load of weight lifted (dumbbells, bands, or body weight) multiplied by repetitions. You'll be changing up your volume as you progress through each workout. And no, you won't need a calculator or degree in algebra.<br><br>Cycles describe sections of your workout--specifically, macro-cycles and micro-cycles. A macro-cycle in this book lasts 6 weeks and is broken down into weekly training emphases (micro-cycles). The goal of the macro-cycle is to maximize adaptation and thus prevent plateaus. Basically, you'll advance from easier workouts that use lighter weights to progressively heavier weights and more reps per exercise set. Unlike traditional exercise programs, which either keep the repetitions the same throughout the year or may go through different rep ranges in one workout, periodization training alters resistance and rep considerations. These regular changes not only provide differing emphases on your muscles but also keep your enthusiasm up and boredom at bay.<br><br>Intensity is the level of effort you put forth. During cardio training, working out at a particular percentage of your heart rate is an indicator of intensity. In resistance training, intensity can be determined by working with maximum load for a certain number of repetitions.<br><br>Frequency is a darn good movie with Dennis Quaid. It also refers to the number of training sessions per day, week, or month. For example, the old standard has been 3 days per week, but I'm going to show you the benefits of working out most days of the week, starting with 20 minutes a day and progressing to 55 minutes a day.<br><br>Active rest is not a time of inactivity but a transition period that allows the body to rest before it begins another micro-cycle of training. Active rest includes physical activities that pump up the fun, such as sports, cycling, swimming, dance, and yoga. In the next chapter, I'll help you identify the activities that are the best fit for you.<br><br>With periodization training, you'll learn how to make your muscles do unexpected and unfamiliar things, or familiar things in unexpected ways so that you keep burning fat and your fitness curve continues to climb skyward. You'll learn how to continually challenge your muscles into responding--the secret behind getting results. Your body doesn't respond to repetition; it responds to novelty. Often, people assume the key to persevering is to master one or two workouts, when, in fact, monotony is often a huge reason for failure. I advocate variety: Shake it up and do something different every day. You want it, I've got it: cardio, strength, flexibility, balance work, belly and core exercises, and plenty of muscle sculpting. It's all in here. It's a form of physical chess. Your body doesn't know what's coming next and is constantly stimulated to change and forced to adapt to that change. Boredom and injuries are eliminated because volume, cycles, intensity, frequency, and active rest won't let them happen.<br><br>And instead of working each body part individually, like many other workout programs suggest, I combine exercises so you get an all-in-one body-toning, muscle-sculpting, fat-burning work-out. Think of it as multitasking for your muscles.<br><br>In addition, your body will constantly face new challenges. This workout is not about simply checking off boxes and advancing from one level to the next. In fact, it's a little like rock climbing-- filled with challenging, ever-changing "terrain" and surprises. The unfamiliarity of a variety of different exercise techniques will help your body burn fat continuously, stimulate new muscle growth, protect connective tissue, prevent boredom, and get you into the best shape of your life. A vast majority of my moves and exercises are extreme and dynamic--nothing is stale or boring, I promise. I'll give you the most effective, varied routines imaginable, regardless of whether you have an hour or just 20 minutes to devote to exercise. Even if you hate exercise now, you're going to develop a true passion for fitness.<br><br>PRINCIPLE #3: Progression<br><br>The exercise personality test in Chapter 2 will help you figure out your current fitness level and the program best suited to your needs. I've designed workouts for three levels of fitness: Beginners, Strivers, and Warriors. No matter which program you select, you'll see improvements in how you feel and look within the first week. That's because I'm going to give you a unique three-tiered program, with specific strategies to help you advance your fitness level.<br><br>Each program contains core conditioning, cardio workouts, interval training, resistance training, and flexibility exercises. You'll progress within each of these workouts, starting with Phase 1 routines and moving right up to more intense Phase 2 routines. If you're a Beginner, I'll show you how to move up to Striver and ultimately to Warrior. Same goes for Strivers; you'll progress to a Warrior. If you start as a Warrior, you'll experience the kind of results you've been dreaming about. This three- tiered approach is great for everyone, from first timers to highly advanced fitness buffs. The secret is simple: Change the routines, amp up the intensity, and bask in the results. As your overall level of health and fitness improves, so will your physique, mood, strength, flexibility, balance, and self-esteem.<br><br>If you follow this program as I've designed it, you'll discover something very powerful: You are tougher than you think! This is the number one piece of feedback I get from people who buy my DVDs and attend my fitness camps and seminars. It turns out that a lot of folks aren't giving their all. The truth is, people aren't seeing results because they barely put in 50 percent, let alone 110.<br><br>Take Brian, for example. At the age of 45, he'd spent most of his life being obese and unhappy. He'd tried every fad diet and gimmick imaginable, only to experience temporary success. "I shouldn't even call it success," he told me. "I should call it failure, because I always ended up heavier than when I started." Sadly, one of the "gimmicks" Brian tried was the fen- phen drug combination, popular in the early 1990s. It caused so much damage to his heart that he was able to receive compensation from a class-action lawsuit filed against the drug company.<br><br>By October 2008, Brian tipped the scales at 308 �ds. Disgusted with himself, he cleaned up his diet and was able to lose some of the weight. But he soon hit a plateau and wasn't losing a �d or an inch. Brian considered trying P90X but feared that it would be "too intense." He overcame his reluctance and bought it anyway. He struggled a little when he started out and made plenty of modifications to suit his fitness level, but within 4 short months (during which he progressed to more challenging routines), Brian stripped off another 102 �ds and now weighs in at a fit 185 �ds. And there's more to his story: Brian reports that he's now in "awesome health"--no more high blood pressure and no more joint pain. Brian, like most people, learned that he was tougher than he'd ever imagined.<br><br>PRINCIPLE #4: Cleanse-Nourish-Supplement<br><br>My eating plan places an emphasis on foods that make you feel good and look good; that is, they boost energy, enhance immunity, promote mental clarity, brighten mood, and improve general health. These very same foods will also help you look your best; they keep your body's fat-burning process going 24/7 while simultaneously supporting the growth of long, lean muscle and promoting healthy, glowing skin, hair, and other aspects of your outer appearance.</p><h2>The Immortal</h2><p>While on vacation in Greece, Josie discovers an ancient artifact--a tiny statue of a goddess--that soon gets her into all kinds of troubles.

His Moscow homecoming is anything but peaceful. In the hotel where he and his loyal if impertinent manservant Masa are staying, Fandorin&#x2019;s old war-hero friend General Michel Sobolev (&#x201c;Achilles&#x201d; to the crowd) has been found dead, felled in his armchair by an apparent heart attack. But Fandorin suspects an unnatural cause. His suspicions lead him to the boudoir of the beautiful singer&#x2013;&#x201c;not exactly a courtesan&#x201d;&#x2013;known as Wanda. Apparently, in Wanda&#x2019;s bed, the general secretly breathed his last. . . .</p><p><b>BORIS AKUNIN </b>is the pen name of Grigory Chkhartishvili, who was born in the republic of Georgia in 1956.

He has written ten Erast Fandorin novels to date, which have sold more than eight million copies in Russia and been translated into nearly two dozen languages. He lives in Moscow.Russian mystery buffs revere Akunin (the pen name for Russian-born essayist and critic Grigory Chkhartishvili), who renders smart, stylistic thrillers set in the late nineteenth century. In the author's fourth novel to be published in the U.S. (after 2005's <i> The Turkish Gambit</i>), -Sherlock Holmes-like special agent Erast Petrovich Fandorin investigates the sudden demise of his old war-hero friend, General Mikhail Sobolev, who died of an apparent heart attack in the arms of a German nightclub singer. Details soon surface about Sobolev's plans for a coup and a missing suitcase containing the rubles to finance it. Fandorin's pursuit of the loot leads to the slums of Khitrovka and the criminally minded head of the governor-general's secret chancellery. The hunter soon becomes the hunted, as Fandorin is tailed by Klonov, an enigmatic assassin. Although some readers may be rattled by the novel's abrupt shift in point of view (from Fandorin's formal style to a more lyrical retelling of the hired-gun's life), Akunin's high-energy ending makes up for the narrative glitch. <i>Allison Block</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The army's enlisted strength, including the Army Air Corps, was only 130,000, much of the equipment, including only 1,700 biplanes, was left over from World War I, and seriously out of date. Following the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the tide of public opinion and official government action changed. Within hours after the attack, machine guns appeared on the roofs of the White House and the Capitol building, which reassured the nation of American resolve to fight and win. Few people knew that the guns were fakes. </p><p>The United States realized that it lacked the necessary troop strength to wage war in Europe, but kept this lack of preparedness secret while working to prepare for war. Gen. George Catlett Marshall proposed a solution: the formation of a small, top-secret, special tactical army group that would function in much the same way as the guns atop the White House, but on a far more elaborate and sophisticated scale.</p><p>The details of the efforts of this army group have, until recently, been classified. It is now known that in all of their missions, over 40,000 lives were saved. Composed of actors, designers, meteorologists, photographers, and sound technicians, the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops repeatedly caused Axis troops to prepare for attacks that would ultimately come from a different direction, mass troops in defensive positions that left them exposed to the allies, and waste ammunition on a phantom enemy.</p><p>Jack M. Kneece interviewed many surviving members of the Ghost Army, including Bill Blass, after the information was declassified in 1996. Kneece was the first reporter to interview Bobby Baker at the height of the Baker/Lyndon Johnson scandal in 1967, and he has since worked for a number of newspapers and wire services across the country. He lives in Peak, South Carolina, where he writes full time. </p><p>Discover the secrets of the small army of actors, sound technicians, and artists who duped the Germans successfully in twenty-one separate operations during World War II, often within a few hundred yards of the front lines.</p><p>The German Army referred to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops as the "Phantom Army" because one day it was in one place, and the next, in another. Though most American, British, and Free French troops never knew of the existence of this highly trained army, all were affected by it.</p><p>Though it sounds more like a movie plot than the real thing, the Ghost Army was real, and was a significant force in the Allied victory. The Ghost Army specialized in illusion: these 1,000 men were practiced in all the arts required to give the strong impression that they were as many as 30,000--and heavily armed. Until recently, all information about these operations has remained secret, while the brave soldiers who saved many lives during the war were denied the medals--even the Purple Heart--which they had earned for the sake of preserving this great military secret. </p><p>In 1996, information about this grand illusion was declassified, and author Jack Kneece set out to interview surviving members of this special group of soldiers. The Ghost Army of World War II tells the history of this force and contains never-heard firsthand accounts of its exploits.</p></p><h2>The Dark Side: The Inside Story of How The War on Terror Turned into a War on American Ideals</h2><p><b>A dramatic and damning narrative account of how America has fought the <br> "War on Terror"<br></b><br>In the days immediately following September 11th, the most powerful people in the country were panic-stricken. The radical decisions about how to combat terrorists and strengthen national security were made in a state of utter chaos and fear, but the key players, Vice President Dick Cheney and his powerful, secretive adviser David Addington, used the crisis to further a long held agenda to enhance Presidential powers to a degree never known in U.S. history, and obliterate Constitutional protections that define the very essence of the American experiment.<br><br>THE DARK SIDE is a dramatic, riveting, and definitive narrative account of how the United States made terrible decisions in the pursuit of terrorists around the world-- decisions that not only violated the Constitution to which White House officials took an oath to uphold, but also hampered the pursuit of Al Qaeda. In gripping detail, acclaimed <i>New Yorker</i> writer and bestselling author, Jane Mayer, relates the impact of these decisions&#x2014;U.S.-held prisoners, some of them completely innocent, were subjected to treatment more reminiscent of the Spanish Inquisition than the twenty-first century.<br><br>THE DARK SIDE will chronicle real, specific cases, shown in real time against the larger tableau of what was happening in Washington, looking at the intelligence gained&#x2014;or not&#x2014;and the price paid. In some instances, torture worked. In many more, it led to false information, sometimes with devastating results. For instance, there is the stunning admission of one of the detainees, Sheikh Ibn al-Libi, that the confession he gave under duress&#x2014;which provided a key piece of evidence buttressing congressional support of going to war against Iraq--was in fact fabricated, to make the torture stop.<br><br>In all cases, whatever the short term gains, there were incalculable losses in terms of moral standing, and our country's place in the world, and its sense of itself. THE DARK SIDE chronicles one of the most disturbing chapters in American history, one that will serve as the lasting legacy of the George W. Bush presidency.</p><p>Jane Mayer is the co-author of two bestselling and critically acclaimed narrative nonfiction books, LANDSLIDE: THE UNMAKING OF THE PRESIDENT, 1984-1988, and STRANGE JUSTICE: THE SELLING OF CLARENCE THOMAS, the latter of which was a finalist for the National Book Award. Mayer was also awarded the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in connection with THE DARK SIDE. <br><br>She is currently a Washington-based staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i>, specializing in political and investigative reporting.

She might become the dictatress of the world: she would be no longer the ruler</i> <i>of her own spirit.&#x201d; </i>&#x2013;John Quincy Adams, <i>An Address . . . Celebrating the Anniversary of Independence, at the City of Washington on the Fourth of July 1821 </i><br>If anyone in America should have been prepared to respond to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, it ought to have been Vice President Dick Cheney. For decades before the planes hit the Pentagon and World Trade Center, Cheney had been secretly practicing for doomsday. <br><br>During the 1980s, while serving as a Republican congressman from Wyoming and a rising power in the conservative leadership in Congress, Cheney secretly participated in one of the most highly classified, top-secret programs of the Reagan Administration, a simulation of survival scenarios designed to ensure the smooth continuity of the U.S. government in the event of all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Every year, usually during congressional recesses, Cheney would disappear in the dead of the night. He left without explanation to his wife, Lynne Vincent Cheney, who was given merely a phone number where he could be reached in the event of emergency. Along with some four or five dozen federal officials, Cheney would pretend for several weeks to be chief of staff to a designated substitute &#x201c;president,&#x201d; bivouacked in some remote location in the United States. <br><br>As James Mann reveals in <i>The Vulcans, </i>his rich intellectual history of the neoconservative brain trust that has guided Bush foreign policy, the exercise tried to re-create some of the anticipated hardships of surviving a nuclear holocaust. Accommodations were Spartan and cuisine was barely adequate. Civilian communications systems were presumed destroyed. The challenge was to ensure civil order and control over the military in the event that the elected president and vice president, and much of the executive branch, were decimated. The Constitution, of course, spells out the line of succession. If the president and vice president are indisposed, then power passes first to the Speaker of the House, and next to the president pro tempore of the Senate. But in a secret executive order, President Reagan, who was deeply concerned about the Soviet threat, amended the process for speed and clarity. The secret order established a means of re-creating the executive branch without informing Congress that it had been sidestepped, or asking for legislation that would have made the new &#x201c;continuity-of-government&#x201d; plan legally legitimate. Cheney, a proponent of expansive presidential powers, was evidently unperturbed by this oversight. <br><br>Mann and others have suggested that these doomsday drills were a dress rehearsal for Cheney&#x2019;s calm, commanding performance on 9/11. It was not the first time he had stared into the abyss. One eyewitness, who kept a diary, said that inside the Presidential Emergency Operations Command, or PEOC, a hardened command center several hundred feet under the by-then-evacuated White House, Cheney never broke a sweat as he juggled orders to shoot down any additional incoming hijacked planes, coordinated efforts with other cabinet members, most particularly the Directors of the FBI and CIA, and resolved issues such as how to avoid charges of taking hostage two visiting foreign heads of state, from Australia and Lithuania, after all air traffic had been shut down. <br><br>Six weeks after the attacks on New York and Washington, the Bush Administration had successfully restored calm, reassured the financial markets, and rallied the sympathies and support of much of the world. But once again the White House was plunged into a state of controlled panic. <br>On October 17, 2001, a white powder that had been sent through the U.S. mail to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle&#x2019;s office in the Capitol was positively identified. Scientific analysis showed it to be an unusually difficult to obtain and lethally potent form of the deadly bacterial poison anthrax. This news followed less than ten days after the death in Florida of a victim in another mysterious anthrax attack. The anthrax spores in the letter to Daschle were so professionally refined, the Central Intelligence Agency believed the powder must have been sent by an experienced terrorist organization, most probably Al Qaeda, as a sequel to the group&#x2019;s September 11 attacks. During a meeting of the White House&#x2019;s National Security Council that day, Cheney, who was sitting in for the President because Bush was traveling abroad, urged everyone to keep this inflammatory speculation secret. <br><br>At the time, no one, not even America&#x2019;s best-informed national security leaders, really knew anything for sure about what sorts of threats loomed, or from where. The only certainty shared by virtually the entire American intelligence community in the fall of 2001 was that a second wave of even more devastating terrorist attacks on America was imminent. In preparation, the CIA had compiled a list of likely targets ranging from movie studios&#x2013;whose heads were warned by the Bush Administration to take precautions&#x2013;to sports arenas and corporate headquarters. Topping the list was the White House. <br><br>The next day, the worst of these fears seemed realized. On October 18, 2001, an alarm in the White House went off. Chillingly, the warning signal wasn&#x2019;t a simple fire alarm triggered by the detection of smoke. It was a sensitive, specialized sensor, designed to alert anyone in the vicinity that the air they were breathing had been contaminated by potentially lethal radioactive, chemical, or biological agents. Everyone who had entered the Situation Room that day was believed to have been exposed, and that included Cheney. &#x201c;They thought there had been a nerve attack,&#x201d; a former administration official, who was sworn to secrecy about it, later confided. &#x201c;It was really, really scary. They thought that Cheney was already lethally infected.&#x201d; Facing the possibility of his own death, the Vice President nonetheless calmly reported the emergency to the rest of the National Security Council. <br><br>Members of the National Security Council were all too well aware of the seriousness of the peril they were facing. At Cheney&#x2019;s urging, they had received a harrowing briefing just a few weeks earlier about the possibility of biological attack. His attention had been drawn to the subject by a war game called Dark Winter conducted in the summer before that simulated the effects of an outbreak of smallpox in America. After the September 11 attacks, Cheney&#x2019;s chief of staff, <br><br>I. Lewis &#x201c;Scooter&#x201d; Libby, screened a video of the Dark Winter exercise for Cheney, showing that the United States was virtually defenseless against smallpox or any other biological attack. Cheney in particular was so stricken by the potential for attack that he insisted that the rest of the National Security Council undergo a gruesome briefing on it on September 20, 2001. When the White House sensor registered the presence of such poisons less than a month later, many, including Cheney, believed a nightmare was unfolding. &#x201c;It was a really nerve-jangling time,&#x201d; the former official said. <br><br>In time, the Situation Room alarm turned out to be false. But on October 22, the Secret Service reported that it had found what it believed to be additional anthrax traces on an automated letter-opening device used on White House mail. By then, Cheney had convinced the President to support a $1.6 billion bioterrorism-preparedness program. Cheney argued that every citizen in the country should be vaccinated against smallpox. <br><br>During the ten days after the Vice President&#x2019;s scare, threats of mortal attack were nonetheless so frequent, and so terrifying, that on October 29 Cheney quietly insisted upon absenting himself from the White House to what was described as &#x201c;a secure, undisclosed location&#x201d;&#x2013;one of several Cold War&#x2014;era nuclear-hardened subterranean bunkers built during the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations, the nearest of which were located hundreds of feet below bedrock in places such as Mount Weather, in Virginia&#x2019;s Blue Ridge Mountains, and along the Maryland-Pennsylvania border not far from Camp David. <br>In a subterranean bunker crammed with communications equipment and government-issue metal desks, Cheney and other rotating cabinet members took turns occupying what was archly referred to as &#x201c;The Commander in Chief&#x2019;s Suite.&#x201d; <br><br>Officials who worked in the White House and other sensitive posts with access to raw intelligence files during the fall of 2001 say it is nearly impossible to exaggerate the sense of mortal and existential danger that dominated the thinking of the upper rungs of the Bush Administration during those months. <br>&#x201c;They thought they were going to get hit again. They convinced themselves that they were facing a ticking time bomb,&#x201d; recalled Roger Cressey, who then headed what was known as the Terrorist Threats Sub-Group of the National Security Council. <br><br>Counterterrorism experts knew that Al Qaeda&#x2019;s members had in the recent past made efforts to obtain nuclear and other horrific weapons of mass destruction in order to commit murder on an even greater scale. Unlike earlier enemies of America, they targeted innocent civilians and fought clandestinely with inhuman disregard for life. Other foes had been better organized and more powerful, but none had struck as great a blow behind the lines in America, nor spread a greater sense of vulnerability in the population. Under the circumstances, Cressey admitted, &#x201c;I firmly expected to get hit again too. It seemed highly probable.&#x201d; <br>The sense of fear within the White House was understandable, but it was intensi&#x282;...</p><h2>The Cold Moon: A Lincoln Rhyme Novel</h2><p>On a freezing December night, with a full moon hovering in the black sky over New York City, two people are brutally murdered -- the death scenes marked by eerie, matching calling cards: moon-faced clocks inves-tigators fear ticked away the victims' last moments on earth.

He looked in the rearview mirror again and concentrated on his driving. The hour was just past midnight and the streets in lower Manhattan were icy. A cold front had swept the sky clear and turned an earlier snow to slick glaze on the asphalt and concrete. The two men were in the rattling Band-Aid-mobile, as Clever Vincent had dubbed the tan SUV. It was a few years old; the brakes needed servicing and the tires replacing. But taking a stolen vehicle in for work would not be a wise idea, especially since two of its recent passengers were now murder victims. </p><p> The driver -- a lean man in his fifties, with trim black hair -- made a careful turn down a side street and continued his journey, never speeding, making precise turns, perfectly centered in his lane. He'd drive the same whether the streets were slippery or dry, whether the vehicle had just been involved in murder or not. </p><p> Careful, meticulous. </p><p> <i>How long did it take?</i> </p><p> Big Vincent -- Vincent with long, sausage fingers, always damp, and a taut brown belt stretching the first hole -- shivered hard. He'd been waiting on the street corner after his night shift as a word-processing temp. It was bitterly cold but Vincent didn't like the lobby of his building. The light was greenish and the walls were covered with big mirrors in which he could see his oval body from all angles. So he'd stepped into the clear, cold December air and paced and ate a candy bar. Okay, two. </p><p> As Vincent was glancing up at the full moon, a shockingly white disk visible for a moment through a canyon of buildings, the Watchmaker reflected aloud, "How long did it take them to die? Interesting." </p><p> Vincent had known the Watchmaker -- whose real name was Gerald Duncan -- for only a short time but he'd learned that you asked the man questions at your own risk. Even a simple query could open the door to a monologue. Man, could he talk. And his answers were always organized, like a college professor's. Vincent knew that the silence for the last few minutes was because Duncan was considering his answer. </p><p> Vincent opened a can of Pepsi. He was cold but he needed something sweet. He chugged it and put the empty can in his pocket. He ate a packet of peanut butter crackers. Duncan looked over to make sure Vincent was wearing gloves. They always wore gloves in the Band-Aid-Mobile. </p><p> <i>Meticulous...</i> </p><p> "I'd say there are several answers to that," Duncan said in his soft, detached voice. "For instance, the first one I killed was twenty-four, so you could say it took him twenty-four years to die." </p><p> Like, <i>yeah</i>...thought Clever Vincent with the sarcasm of a teenager, though he had to admit that this obvious answer hadn't occurred to him. </p><p> "The other was thirty-two, I think." </p><p> A police car drove by, the opposite way. The blood in Vincent's temples began pounding but Duncan didn't react. The cops showed no interest in the stolen Explorer. </p><p> "Another way to answer the question," Duncan said, "is to consider the elapsed time from the moment I started until their hearts stopped beating. That's probably what you meant. See, people want to put time into easy-to-digest frames of reference. That's valid, as long as it's helpful. Knowing the contractions come every twenty seconds is helpful. So is knowing that the athlete ran a mile in three minutes, fifty-eight seconds, so he wins the race. Specifically how long it took them tonight to die...well, that isn't important, as long as it wasn't fast." A glance at Vincent. "I'm not being critical of your question." </p><p> "No," Vincent said, not caring if he was critical. Vincent Reynolds didn't have many friends and could put up with a lot from Gerald Duncan. "I was just curious." </p><p> "I understand. I just didn't pay any attention. But the next one, I'll time it." </p><p> "The girl? Tomorrow?" Vincent's heart beat just a bit faster. </p><p> He nodded. "Later today, you mean." </p><p> It was after midnight. With Gerald Duncan you had to be precise, especially when it came to time. </p><p> "Right." </p><p> Hungry Vincent had nosed out Clever Vincent now that he was thinking of Joanne, the girl who'd die next. </p><p> <i>Later today...</i> </p><p> The killer drove in a complicated pattern back to their temporary home in the Chelsea district of Manhattan, south of Midtown, near the river. The streets were deserted; the temperature was in the teens and the wind flowed steadily through the narrow streets. </p><p> Duncan parked at a curb and shut the engine off, set the parking brake. The men stepped out. They walked for a half block through the icy wind. Duncan glanced down at his shadow on the sidewalk, cast by the moon. "I've thought of another answer. About how long it took them to die." </p><p> Vincent shivered again -- mostly, but not only, from the cold. </p><p> "When you look at it from their point of view," the killer said, "you could say that it took forever." </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2006 by Jeffery Deaver</p></p><h2>Love Goes to Buildings on Fire: Five Years in New York That Changed Music Forever</h2><p><p>Punk rock and hip-hop. Disco and salsa. The loft jazz scene and the downtown composers known as Minimalists. In the mid-1970s, New York City was a laboratory where all the major styles of modern music were reinvented--all at once, from one block to the next, by musicians who knew, admired, and borrowed from one another. Crime was everywhere, the government was broke, and the city's infrastructure was collapsing. But rent was cheap, and the possibilities for musical exploration were limitless.</p><p><i>Love Goes to Buildings on Fire</i> is the first book to tell the full story of the era's music scenes and the phenomenal and surprising ways they intersected. From New Year's Day 1973 to New Year's Eve 1977, the book moves panoramically from post-Dylan Greenwich Village, to the arson-scarred South Bronx barrios where salsa and hip-hop were created, to the Lower Manhattan lofts where jazz and classical music were reimagined, to ramshackle clubs like CBGBs and The Gallery, where rock and dance music were hot-wired for a new generation. As they remade the music, the musicians at the center of the book invented themselves: Willie Col�n and the Fania All-Stars renting Yankee Stadium to take salsa to the masses, New Jersey locals Bruce Springsteen and Patti Smith claiming the jungleland of Manhattan as their own, Grandmaster Flash transforming the turntable into a musical instrument, David Byrne and Talking Heads proving that rock music "ain't no foolin' around." Will Hermes was there--venturing from his native Queens to the small dark rooms where the revolution was taking place--and in <i>Love Goes to Buildings on Fire</i> he captures the creativity, drive, and full-out lust for life of the great New York musicians of those years, who knew that the music they were making would change the world.</p></p><p>"(4 stars) The first book to trace the parallel ascents of every sound born in the city in that dense time--not just punk, disco and hip-hop but salsa, loft jazz, and downtown minimalism... Rich in details and laced with the author's own musical memories, this tells the sonic tale of a city at a low point that finds its creative peak."&nbsp; <br>-<b>Mojo magazine UK</b>A fascinating book that covers not only the punk and new rock music of the day, but looks at that period in New York between 1973 and the end of 1977 back to a time a time when hip-hop was being birthed, salsa was finding its voice, the avant-garde scene was being heard, and the new loft jazz scene was being born.<br><b>-Bob Boilen, NPR's <i>All Songs Considered</i></b></p><h2>Eros</h2><p>In Eros, the subtle and profound nuances of the erotic nature of relationships between men and women are explored through a collection of black-and-white photographs that are coupled with inspired, passionate words. Among the photographers whose visions comprise this volume are some of the great masters - Brassai, Imogen Cunningham, Horst, Man Ray, Minor White, Edward Weston - as well as many celebrated contemporary artists - Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Hiro, Annie Leibovitz, Robert Mapplethorpe, Duane Michals, Helmut Newton, and Albert Watson, among others. Deeply involved as they are with the relationship between seeing and feeling, their images take us on a rich visual journey ranging from the eloquent beauty of the human form to the complexity of body language motivated by desire.<br>This compendium of expressive photographs is accented with a variety of literary selections drawn from the work of writers such as Margaret Atwood, Siv Cedering, John Cleland, E. E. Cummings, Michael Fried, Robert Graves, Erica Jong, D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, Anais Nin, Carson Reed, Dylan Thomas, and Walt Whitman. Embracing the spectrum of the erotic experience - from quiet intimacy and meditation to frank lust and reckless abandon - their words highlight the power of Eros not only to thrill and delight but also to uplift and transform.</p><p>A joyful, uninhibited and tasteful celebration of heterosexual love and the human body, this portfolio weds photographs by Helmut Newton, Edward Weston, Annie Leibovitz, Imogen Cunningham, Manuel Alvaro Bravo, Robert Mapplethorpe, Greg Gorman, Brassai, Man Ray and others to erotic prose and poetry selections. Earthy snippets from Henry Miller, Sallie Tisdale, D.H. Lawrence, Erica Jong, Frank Harris and Jeanette Winterson tie sexual delight to love, spiritual rapture, curiosity and exploration of self and other. Walt Whitman's incantatory lyric "This is the female form" seems perfectly juxtaposed with Barbara Brodnick's buxom Nude 1. Although the pictures have a certain sameness, there are dozens of strong, complex compositions in a variety of settings, and the poetry selections, ranging from Robert Graves and Muriel Rukeyser to Ezra Pound's translation of an ancient Egyptian ode, are marvelous.

Then sit yourselves down on this bench, like good children, and I&#x2019;ll tell you a story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#x2019;ve ever studied geography, then you know that not far from Mount Hotzemklotzem lies a river called the Ampsel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All week long, the river Ampsel spews a boiling sealing wax that makes it impossible to even get close. If you do, you instantly get sealed up--a package ready for the Angel of Souls, who stands by with an inkwell, immediately writes down an address, and sends you off to the World to Come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But once in 666 years, when the Sabbath falls on a Wednesday, you can approach the river backward so it thinks you&#x2019;re actually walking away. And when you&#x2019;re just close enough, you throw a blue onion over your shoulder and say three times:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Echepeche meche-merly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Little river, it&#x2019;s still early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This scares the river Ampsel, and it freezes with trembling waves on both sides, like the angry lips of an irate person whose mouth has opened and can&#x2019;t be shut. And that&#x2019;s when you jump off Mount Hotzemklotzem, sitting on your hands--which you hold together under yourself like a little bench--and start flying wherever you want. You fly for a day and a night, and then another day and a night, until you fly into the very middle of Shortfriday and tear it into two halves. One half runs off to the left, the second to the right, and you end up standing just where you ought to be, that is: in Tearania.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is obviously easier said than done. Before you break into Tearania, you have to first bathe in the Goldwater of Ashm, where the Ampsel flows into the Krikrama. When you come out, you look like a golden figure on a sign--completely gold and, besides that, not moving your feet. The Goldwater of Ashm has this quality that whoever bathes in its waters starts walking with their neck. That is, your feet stand or sit in place, while your neck stretches out on its own and your head goes wherever you want. That&#x2019;s why all the inhabitants of Tearania have such long necks--except when their necks come back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But the main story we want to tell you, children, is about the salt that doesn&#x2019;t exist there and that, if it were to exist, would possibly make it the happiest place in the world!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s like this. The region around the Ampsel is very rich. The soil is not actually soil but rich, freshly baked bread. When you&#x2019;re hungry, you tear off a piece of hot soil and eat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Or when you want meat, you don&#x2019;t need to spill any blood, the way we do, but what? You just unzip the hide of a cow or an ox. (Hides in this place are undone with zippers under the bellies.) You tear off whatever piece of meat you want--you just have to leave behind the end, and soon a new animal grows beneath the very same hide. And it doesn&#x2019;t even feel that it&#x2019;s a different animal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for rain--in Tearania, it rains wine. If you want to sleep, there are mountains made of cotton balls. Otherwise you just sneeze and geese come flying, stuffing themselves inside white pillowcases they carry in their little bills, and you sleep to your heart&#x2019;s content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But there&#x2019;s one thing, children, they don&#x2019;t have in Tearania: salt!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They have everything: gold and silver, coal and oil, iron and copper, brass and tin, bread and meat, honey and almonds, icebox cakes and malted milk shakes. And in short, it&#x2019;s a place where you can live and laugh.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Laugh? No. I haven&#x2019;t told the truth. In Tearania, people cry more than they laugh. That is, they could laugh in Tearania, and why not? Such a land! Such plenty! Such soil! Such animals! But what? It&#x2019;s just the same thing again: salt!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since there&#x2019;s no salt, parents smack their children so that they cry and salt the bread. And when children refuse to cry, they get smacked even more. And if they don&#x2019;t want to cry straight onto the bread, they get a proper swat. After the children have cried out all their tears and salted their little lunches, the whole story starts all over again with dinner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The mother says to the father:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You have to cry out the bread today.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The father says to the mother:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Me? Why me? You can cry! I feel joy in my heart today--I&#x2019;ve had some brandy.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d; says the mother. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re becoming a drunk on top of it all!&#x201d; And she starts to cry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The father rushes over and slides a fresh cucumber just under her eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The mother says to the father:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Take the cucumber away, you drunkard.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The father says to the mother:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly. I just said that because an unsalted cucumber has no taste.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These kinds of scenes would occur in Tearania almost every day. Until one person--a wise man and watchmaker--invented a patent. Instead of smacking children or upsetting wives, people would be better off if, at every meal, they placed a lady near the table to grate horseradish, so that tears would flow from everyone and fall straight into their bowls of noodle soup--or onto their hot dumplings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Translated by David Stromberg</p></p><h2>Painting Flowers the Van Wyk Way</h2><p>with step by step instructions, and examples of the author's work, where she breaks down floral anatomy into manageable shapes and lines, that artists of all abilities can master.

He was never accepted by the Russian public as being completely Russian in his thinking and political ideology, and indeed he was not. Gogol&#39;s Ukrainian upbringing is most evident in his early works which draw heavily from Ukrainian culture and folk history. His later writing was more subversive, openly satirizing the corruption he saw rampant throughout Russia&#39;s empire. Gogol was homosexual. At age seventeen he wrote passionate letters to a friend who, being two years older, had graduated before Gogol, leaving him bereft. Gogol eventually exiled himself from Russia, living in Rome. It was here that he enjoyed at least one mutual love affair with a man, but his lover died within a year of their meeting. Two years later Gogol fell in love with the poet Nikolai Yazykov and penned love letters to him, but his efforts came to nothing. Gogol died in Moscow and was buried at Davilov Monastery. His last words were placed on his tombstone: &#34;And I shall laugh my bitter laugh.&#34; When Soviet authorities decided to demolish the monastery in 1931 and transfer Gogol&#39;s remains, it was discovered his body had been buried lying face down, leading some to wonder if he had been buried alive.The title loony, an obsessive petty bureaucrat, first saw the literary light of day in 1835, when his creator, Russia's first great fiction writer, was gaining his initial renown. Backed up by percussion instruments, Stephen Ouimette impersonates him here in a Stratford Festival staged reading, which was recorded by the CBC in Toronto. By and large, the story satirizes the officialdom of the time and place, but Ouimette, while doing his best with humor that has gotten a bit stale, chillingly plays his character's descent into madness.

In <i>Reacher Said Nothing,</i> Andy Martin shadows Child like a literary private eye in a yearlong investigation of what it takes to make fiction&#x2019;s hottest hero hit the page running. The result is a fascinating, up-close-and-personal look into the world and ways of an expert storyteller&#x2019;s creative process as he undertakes the writing of the much anticipated twentieth Jack Reacher novel, <i>Make Me</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fueled by copious mugs of black coffee, Lee Child squares off against the blank page (or, rather, computer screen), eager to follow his wandering imagination in search of a plot worthy of the rough and ready Reacher. While working in fits and starts, fine-tuning sentences, characters, twists and turns, Child plies Martin with anecdotes and insights about the life and times that shaped the man and his methods: from schoolyard scraps and dismal factory jobs to a successful TV production career and the life-changing decision to put pencil to paper. Then there&#x2019;s the chance encounter that transformed aspiring author James Grant into household name &#x201c;Lee Child.&#x201d; And between bouts at the keyboard in an office high above Manhattan, there are jaunts to writers&#x2019; conventions, book signings, publishing powwows, chat shows, the Prado in Madrid, American diners, and English pubs.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Can I&#x2014;the storyteller&#x2014;get away with this?&#x201d; </i>Lee<i> </i>Child ponders, as he hones and hammers his latest nail-biter into fighting trim. Numerous bestsellers and near worldwide fame say he can. Jack Reacher may be a man of few words, but <i>Reacher Said Nothing</i> says it all about a certain tall man with a talent for coming out on top.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Reacher Said Nothing</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Martin, an unabashed fan of Child&#x2019;s work, conveys his excitement at hanging out with Child.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;<br></i></b>&#x201c;In more than seventy tight vignettes . . . Child, his backstory, and his work come alive. Martin&#x2019;s irrepressible glee about the project is infectious. Recommended for fans of Child&#x2019;s work or aspiring novelists who could benefit from an insider&#x2019;s view of the messy, complicated, and transcendent act of writing.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Amazingly enjoyable and genuinely enlightening, largely because Lee Child is as thoughtful and as amusing as you&#x2019;d think from reading his great thrillers.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Sullivan County Democrat</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An unusual entry in the annals of literary biography . . . fascinating . . .

It&#x2019;s quizzical and respectful, sophisticated and self-deprecating.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Professor Dame Gillian Beer</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Andy Martin is no mere &#x2018;Reacher Creature,&#x2019; as fans of Lee Child&#x2019;s Jack Reacher are known. He&#x2019;s something of a Reacher Teacher. Martin&#x2019;s book is the perfect accompaniment to all things Reacher. It explores, it explains, and it entertains. Like a detective novel, <i>Reacher Said Nothing</i> takes you down alleys and lanes and streets cast in shadow&#x2014;but the journey isn&#x2019;t urban, it&#x2019;s in the boulevards and byways between your own ears. Andy&#x2019;s writing is a brainiac&#x2019;s delight.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Sam Fussell, author of <i>Muscle</i></b></p><p><b>Andy Martin</b> is a former fellow of the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library.

With a burial.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lee stubbed out a final Camel filter cigarette (except it was anything but final) and breathed out a cloud of New York Times no. 1 bestseller smoke. Leaned back in his chair and scrutinized the last sentence of Personal:<br> &nbsp;<br> O&#x2019;Day was to be awarded three more medals posthumously, and a bridge was to be named after him, on a North Carolina state route, over a narrow stream that most of the year was dry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Always good to end with a death, of course. Posthumously...it was like hammering a last nail into the coffin. Or more, planting a gravestone. There was a finality to it. A valediction. But then it was a pointlessly inadequate memorial. He liked anything to do with bridges and routes (so much sheer hard labor had gone into them), but he particularly liked the dried-up stream. So the bridge was pointless too.<br> &nbsp;<br> And his own stream, the great flow of inspiration that had kept the novel afloat for the last eight months&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t that about dried up now too? &#x201c;A narrow stream that most of the year was dry.&#x201d; Could that be...me?<br> &nbsp;<br> What the hell, it was all like a diary anyway, only masquerading as an adventure.<br> &nbsp;<br> THE END.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t write it down. Didn&#x2019;t need to. He knew he was supposed to put it in for the benefit of the typesetters, but he didn&#x2019;t see the necessity. That great sense of an ending&#x2014;the release, the relief, the closure, that satisfying last expulsion of smoke&#x2014;it all had to be contained in the rhythm and feel of the last sentence. The End had to be nailed right there. Those concluding lines, like the final notes of a Beethoven symphony, a coda, had to have some kind of dying cadence to them, a falling away, an elegiac cessation that said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve said everything I needed to say.&#x201d; So you really didn&#x2019;t need to write &#x201c;THE END&#x201d; too. It offended his sense of economy. Two words too many. If it was the right sentence, the sentence would say it for him.<br> &nbsp;<br> He couldn&#x2019;t hit SEND just yet though. He would have to wait a couple of days, let it percolate in his head, see what subliminal second thoughts might bubble up. But all the loose ends had been tied up with a bow. Personal, his nineteenth Jack Reacher novel&#x2014;done.<br> &nbsp;<br> Word count: 107,000. Substantially across the crucial one hundred thousand line. That&#x2019;s what it said on the contract. Anything shorter and it would be too short. Still, 107,000 was relatively short for him. The Enemy, for example, was a full 140k. But it was enough. His books had been getting shorter and tighter. He loved the beginning, that gorgeous feeling when nothing has been screwed up yet. Loved the ending too, that great rush towards the finale, when it was all downhill. But the middle&#x2014;the middle was always a struggle&#x2014;by around page 2 it was like rolling the rock up the hill again day after day. He&#x2019;d developed a cunning strategy for Personal though, had pretty much outwitted the middle&#x2014;he just left it out, fast-forwarded straight from the beginning right through to the end, without a pause, nonstop. Problem solved.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anyway, it had been a blast, the whole way&#x2014;Paris, London, Romford&#x2014;so fuck it, it would have to do. He wasn&#x2019;t going to change it now.<br> &nbsp;<br> He glanced at the time on the computer screen: 10:26, Tuesday night. April 15, 2014. (Reacher, he considered, would know what time it was automatically, without having to check with a mere machine&#x2014;but of course, he&#x2014;Lee&#x2014;was not Reacher, he had to keep reminding himself. There was so much Reacher could do&#x2014;about the one thing he couldn&#x2019;t do was write a novel about his own experience. Which was why Reacher still needed him.) He&#x2019;d written the first line on September 1, 2013. It had to be September&nbsp;1. Every year. Without fail. Now it was over.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lee turned his head away from the screen and looked out of the big window to his left. Tonight the Empire State Building was lit up orange and green&#x2014;pistachio, like some dumb giant ice-cream cone. It didn&#x2019;t used to look that way. Once it had had only clean vapor lights, white light or maybe yellow, so it was like looking up at heaven. Now, with the coming of LED, it could look like anything anybody wanted&#x2014;it could be red, white, and blue on July 4, for example. But mostly it looked like a bad 1970s disco light show. It used to be an immense, stately edifice, he thought. Now it&#x2019;s ice cream. Like dressing Jack Reacher up like a disco dancer. It was this view that had convinced him to come and live here, on 22nd Street, on the twenty-fifth floor of a building across from the Flatiron Building. Now&#x2014;cheapened, stupid, gaudy&#x2014;the view made it less of a wrench to leave. Farewell, Empire State; I loved you once. Or maybe twice.<br> &nbsp;<br> He still remembered that feeling he&#x2019;d had when he first came here. The romance. With the Empire State framed in the window, it would be like living in the offices of the Daily Planet in Metropolis: oh look, isn&#x2019;t that mild-mannered, neatly suited Clark Kent up there in the clouds, looking out masterfully on the world (with lovely Lois Lane by his side)? And wouldn&#x2019;t his superhuman powers extend to writing too? It was logical. Wouldn&#x2019;t a writer from Krypton be all-powerful, all-conquering&#x2014;a Superman among writers?<br> &nbsp;<br> My Home in America. That other great work of literature that always sprang back to mind&#x2014;was never really out of his mind. His genesis and exodus. The book of commandments that had guided him here in the first place. He had come across it, aged five, in the old Elmwood Public Library, in Birmingham. It was just lying there on the floor. He&#x2019;d picked it up. A stiff, cardboard sort of book, mostly illustrations with just a few words. With pictures of children in their faraway homes&#x2014;he remembered a new England colonial &#x201c;saltbox,&#x201d; an isolated farmhouse on the prairies, and a Californian beach house with surfboards and palm trees. But the picture he always went back to (he borrowed the book and took it home and eventually returned it, much thumbed, but he had carried it around with him in his head ever since, pristine and perfect, a portable Garden of Eden) was the one of the apple-cheeked boy who lived in New York. He lived on the nth floor of some lofty Manhattan apartment block, reaching right up into the sky, with a bird flying by. And he was looking out of his window at the Empire State Building. Lee Child was that boy, half a century later. He had always wanted to be him, had just temporarily been trapped in the wrong country or the wrong body.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was like a brain transplant&#x2014;or metempsychosis&#x2014;or d�j� vu, he must have been that New York boy in a previous life, and somehow he had contrived to get back to what he always had been. A kid in a skyscraper.<br> &nbsp;<br> And yet now he was leaving.<br> &nbsp;<br> The apartment he called his &#x201c;office&#x201d; had been emptied out. Hoovered clean. The white walls were a blank. It was not just the end of one novel, it was the end of a whole string of novels, the end of an era that would forever be identified with this place. Another time, he might have stood up and picked up the red Fender he kept in the corner for celebratory moments like this one. Plugged it in and switched on the amp. Turned the volume up high. Put the strap over his head and hoisted up the mast of the guitar, stared out into the night and tightened the fingers of his left hand over the frets and wound up his right arm and unleashed the plectrum over the strings. And some mighty earth-shattering chord would rip out into the darkness, accompanied by obscene pelvic thrusting.<br> &nbsp;<br> Except all the guitars had been shipped back to England. And...oh yeah, he couldn&#x2019;t play a note. He was no musician. The guitars were just there for inspiration. Maybe he&#x2019;d come back as a rock star. (Or maybe a soccer player? Georgie Best or Lionel Messi would do.)<br> &nbsp;<br> Even his desk had been taken: he was perched on an old dining&nbsp;table, white, circular, sitting on a black dining chair. Not even&nbsp;a decent ashtray (the saucer was full of butts&#x2014;where was he&nbsp;supposed to empty it? The wastebasket had gone too). He felt like a refugee crouched in the corner of an abandoned building. Squatting. Like the last man left alive, staring out at the abyss, the ruined deserted city that was once New York. Just him and a few postapocalyptic rats. And a coffee machine.<br> &nbsp;<br> He took the phone out of his pocket and switched it back on. It pinged with a text from his daughter, Ruth.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey, Doof!&#x201d; it began (short for dufus).<br> &nbsp;<br> Lee smiled. Okay, not quite all alone. She was the one who had started it, all the talk about moving. Maybe she was right though, maybe he had been vaguely dissatisfied. And now he was really dissatisfied.<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d had to finish by April. Moving date was the 24th. Most of the furniture had already gone. The books had all gone. They&#x2019;d left him the computer, the old Mac desktop. Now it was doomed. He wasn&#x2019;t going to take it with him. He shut it down for the night. It didn&#x2019;t know it was junk just yet. Shhh.</p><h2>Vines, Grapes and Wines</h2><p>As more and more wine consumers become grape conscious, they identify and buy wine according to its grape�&#x20ac;&#x201d;and this is the guide to help them choose. Written by one of the world�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s most highly respected wine writers, <i>Vines, Grapes, &amp; Wines</i> covers the numerous grape varieties that are grown internationally, examining an extensive range of the varieties that the enthusiast is likely to encounter both as a plant and as a wine style. Each one is described in its geographical context, and there are hundreds of inspiring illustrations throughout.<br> <br><i>Winner of the Veuve Clicquot Wine Book of the Year and André Simon Drink Book of the Year awards</i><br></p><p>Jancis Robinson MW is internationally renowned for her witty, authoritative wine writing and her books The World Atlas of Wine and The Oxford Companion to Wine are among the most important in wine literature. She is acclaimed as &#39;awesomely intelligent&#39; (Guardian) and &#39;a writer of breathtaking clarity&#39; (The Spectator). With www.JancisRobinson.com (subscribers in nearly 100 countries) and her flock of Twitter followers, she is something of an online pioneer as a wine communicator. She makes frequent visits to the USA to stay ahead of the crowd and, in the early 1980s, was the first British journalist to take a serious interest in American wine.Robinson, author of The Great Wine Book ( LJ 2/1/83 ), approaches wine in this book by examining the nearly 1000 varieties of grapes used by winemakers around the world. Maps of major wine producing regions show the international distribution of grapevine varieties. More detailed maps and descriptions of great vineyards illustrate the effects of climate and geography on the selection of grapevines. Descriptions of 9 "classic" and 28 "major" vine varieties present qualitative and quantitative assessments of the most popular grapes. A country by country listing of less popular varieties adds information about the taste and status of hundreds of unique wine grapes. This is an important and accessible book for wine connoisseurs.

With the questionable legality of the adventure&#x2014;and the threat of some very powerful enemies!&#x2014;Sam thought it&#x2019;d be a while before he returned to France, especially with the charms of the beautiful Elena Morales to keep him in Los Angeles.<br><br> But when the immensely wealthy Francis Reboul&#x2014;the victim of Sam&#x2019;s last heist but someone who knows talent when he sees it&#x2014;asks our hero to take a job in Marseille, it&#x2019;s impossible for Sam and Elena to resist the possibility of further excitement . . . to say nothing of the pleasures of the region. Soon the two are enjoying the coastal sunshine and the delectable food and wine for which Marseille is known. Yet as a competition over Marseille&#x2019;s valuable waterfront grows more hotly disputed, Sam, representing Reboul, finds himself in the middle of an increasingly intrigue-ridden and dangerous real-estate grab, with thuggish gangsters on one side and sharklike developers on the other.<br><br> Will Sam survive this caper unscathed? Will he live to enjoy another bowl of bouillabaisse? All will be revealed&#x2014;with luck, savvy, and a lot of help from Sam&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;in the novel&#x2019;s wonderfully satisfying climax.&nbsp;</p><p>Peter Mayle is the author of twelve previous books, six of them novels. A recipient of the L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur from the French government for his cultural contributions, he has been living in Provence with his wife, Jennie, for twenty years.<b>One<br></b><br>Shock has a chilling effect, particularly when it takes the form of an unexpected meeting with a man from whom you have recently stolen three million dollars&#x2019; worth of wine. Sam Levitt shivered and pulled his terrycloth robe closer around his body, still damp from an early-morning dip in the Chateau Marmont pool.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; The man on the other side of the table&#x2014;smiling, tanned, immaculate&#x2014;slid a cup of coffee across to Sam. &#x201c;Drink this. It will warm you up. Then we can talk.&#x201d; He leaned back and watched as that first infinitely welcome cup went down, then another, while Sam tried to gather his wits.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam was sitting with Francis &#x201c;Sissou&#x201d; Reboul. The last time they had met had been in Marseille, over a glass of champagne at Le Pharo, Reboul&#x2019;s clifftop palace with a billionaire&#x2019;s view of the Mediterranean. Sam, on assignment from an international insurance company, was hunting for several hundred bottles of vintage Bordeaux that had been stolen from the Hollywood home of Danny Roth, an entertainment lawyer with a weakness for fine wines. After a search that had taken him from L.A. to Paris to Bordeaux to Marseille, Sam had discovered the stolen bottles in Reboul&#x2019;s vast cellar. And, being a man who preferred direct action to long and tiresome negotiations with the authorities, he had stolen them back. That, he had thought, was that. A nice, neat job, with no complaints likely from the victim. But here was the victim himself, in the garden of the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, behaving for all the world like an acquaintance who was trying to be a friend.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Perhaps I should have given you some warning,&#x201d; said Reboul, with a shrug, &#x201c;but I only flew into Los Angeles last night&#x2014;there&#x2019;s some business I need to attend to here&#x2014;and I thought I would take the opportunity to come and say <i>bonjour</i>.&#x201d; He took a card from his top pocket and pushed it across the table. &#x201c;You see? Here&#x2019;s the little souvenir you gave me during our last meeting.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam glanced down at the familiar sight of his own business card. &#x201c;Well, Mr. Reboul . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Please.&#x201d; Reboul waved a dismissive hand. &#x201c;You must call me Francis, and I will call you Sam. More cozy, <i>non</i>?&#x201d; He smiled and nodded, as though the idea of coziness were amusing. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to waste your time, so let me get to the point.&#x201d; He drank the last of his coffee and pushed his cup and saucer to one side with a manicured index finger. &#x201c;In fact, the business that brings me to California is you.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboul paused for a moment and gave Sam a conspiratorial wink before continuing. &#x201c;I have a situation in Marseille that requires someone&#x2014;ideally, as you will see, an American&#x2014;with particular and rather unusual gifts. And judging from our previous encounter, it seems to me that you would be just the man for the job. What would you say to a few weeks in Marseille? It&#x2019;s at its best this time of year, before the full heat of summer. I would make your stay extremely comfortable and, of course, very attractive financially.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspicion fought with curiosity, and curiosity won. &#x201c;Let me guess.&#x201d; Sam returned Reboul&#x2019;s wink. &#x201c;Would I be right in saying that what you have in mind is not altogether legal?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboul frowned and shook his head, as though Sam had suggested something faintly improper. &#x201c;Legality is so difficult, isn&#x2019;t it? If it were easier to define, most of the lawyers in the world would be out of business, which would be no bad thing. But my dear Sam, allow me to put your conscience at rest: I&#x2019;m not proposing anything more illegal than a little harmless deception&#x2014;and after your performance as a book publisher the last time we met, this would be child&#x2019;s play for a man of your talents. A mere <i>soupe de f�ves</i>, as we say in Marseille.&#x201d; Reboul&#x2019;s attention suddenly shifted from Sam to the woman making her way through the garden toward their table. &#x201c;How delightful,&#x201d; he said, smoothing his hair and standing up. &#x201c;We have a visitor.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam turned to see Elena Morales, dressed in what she called her client uniform of black suit and black high heels, and carrying a slim black briefcase, the businesslike effect enlivened by a discreet flurry of black lace visible beneath the opening of her jacket. She stood over Sam, tapping her watch and looking far from pleased. &#x201c;Is this your idea of casual Friday? Or have you forgotten about the meeting?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Sam. &#x201c;Right. The meeting. Give me five minutes to change, OK?&#x201d; He was aware of Reboul hovering expectantly behind him. &#x201c;Elena, this is Mr. Reboul.&#x201d; Elena smiled and offered her hand. &#x201c;From Marseille,&#x201d; he added.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboul took Elena&#x2019;s hand as though it were a fragile object of immense value, and with a practiced swoop bent and kissed it. &#x201c;<i>Enchant�, mademoiselle, enchant�</i>.&#x201d; He gave the hand a second kiss. Sam resisted the urge to tell Reboul not to talk with his mouth full.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;If you two will excuse me,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back as soon as I&#x2019;ve slipped into my bulletproof vest.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboul pulled out a chair for Elena. &#x201c;How pleasant it is to meet you. Forgive me for making Sam late, but I must have surprised him. The last time we met was in Marseille, and I don&#x2019;t think he expected to see me again.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he didn&#x2019;t. I know all about what happened in Marseille&#x2014;he told me,&#x201d; said Elena. &#x201c;Actually, I hired him. I&#x2019;m with Knox, the insurance company.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you are business colleagues?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now and then. But we&#x2019;re also . . . friends. You know?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboul&#x2019;s eyes twinkled. &#x201c;Lucky man. Perhaps you could help me persuade him to take on this little job for me. Even better&#x2014;perhaps you would come with him.&#x201d; He patted her hand. &#x201c;That would give me great pleasure.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena was aware that Reboul was out to charm her. She was aware, too, that she was rather enjoying it. &#x201c;Where is this little job?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Marseille. It&#x2019;s a fascinating city. Let me tell you about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sam returned to the table, his bathrobe exchanged for a suit and tie, he found Reboul and Elena in animated conversation. It was his turn to stand over Elena, tapping his watch and looking smug.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena looked him up and down and grinned. &#x201c;Very smart. Pity you forgot the socks, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter. We&#x2019;d better go. Where did you leave the car?&#x201d; Turning to Reboul, she said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see you back here this evening, then. In the restaurant at 7:30?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboul inclined his head. &#x201c;I shall count the moments.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam waited until they had joined the traffic on Sunset to head over to Wilshire before he spoke. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s happening this evening?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Francis is taking us to dinner, so he can tell us all about the job.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Us?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;He invited me to Marseille. And I&#x2019;m tempted. More than that&#x2014;I&#x2019;d really like to go. I have a load of vacation time due, I&#x2019;ve never been to the south of France, and Marseille . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;. . . is at its best this time of year.&#x201d; Sam pulled over to pass the bright pink Hummer dawdling along in front of him. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t waste any time, does he?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s cute. And such a gentleman. You know something? I&#x2019;ve never had my hand kissed before.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s against U.S. health and hygiene regulations.&#x201d; Sam shook his head. He knew from past experience that Elena was blessed with a whim of iron: once she had made a decision it was pointless trying to change her mind. And besides, he had to admit that having her with him would make the job a great deal more fun&#x2014;if he decided to take it.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, they had the meeting to get through, and that certainly wasn&#x2019;t going to be fun. They were seeing Danny Roth to tie up the loose ends remaining from the recovery of his stolen wine and its shipment back to the States. There was also the matter of Sam&#x2019;s substantial finder&#x2019;s fee. Even though this was to be shared between Roth and Knox Insurance, Sam anticipated trouble: reluctance to pay at best, outrage and refusal more likely. He pulled up outside the tinted glass cube that was the headquarters of Roth and Partners (those being his mother and his accountant) and cut the engine. &#x201c;Are you ready for this? Don&#x2019;t expect too much hand-kissing.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were met in the reception area by Roth&#x2019;s executive secretary, the tall, regal, and incompetent Cecilia Volp�, who retained her job thanks to her influential father, Myron, one of the handful of powerful, anonymous men who ran Hollywood behind closed doors.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cecilia swayed toward them on four-inch heels, brushing her mane of tawny hair from her forehead, the better to run her eye over Elena&#x2019;s outfit. &#x201c;Love the shoes,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;Louboutin?&#x201d; And then, remembering her duties, &#x201c;Mr. Roth has a very busy schedule today. Will you be long?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam shook his head and smiled. &#x201c;Just as long as it takes to write a check.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cecilia considered Sam&#x2019;s reply for a moment before deciding it was not to be taken seriously. She returned his smile, revealing several thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of exquisitely capped teeth. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d like to follow me?&#x201d; She turned and swayed off down the corridor, her skirt clinging to a pair of buttocks, toned to perfection, that seemed to have a life of their own, twitching with every step. Sam was mesmerized.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena&#x2019;s elbow dug into his ribs. &#x201c;Under no circumstances are you to make any comment. Keep your mind on your work.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cecilia left them at the doorway of Roth&#x2019;s office. He was sitting with his back to them, the dome of his hairless head gleaming in the sunlight that flooded the room. He swiveled around, taking the phone from his ear, and looked at them through narrowed, unfriendly eyes. &#x201c;Will this take long?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I hope not, Mr. Roth.&#x201d; Elena sat down and took some papers from her briefcase. &#x201c;I know you have a very busy schedule. But there are one or two matters that we need to clear up.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roth jerked his head toward Sam. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he doing here?&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; said Sam. &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve just come to pick up my check.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roth assumed a shocked expression. &#x201c;Check? Check? Sure you don&#x2019;t want a goddamn medal as well? Jesus.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena sighed. &#x201c;The finder&#x2019;s fee, Mr. Roth. It&#x2019;s here in the insurance contract.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there they stayed for almost two hours while Roth picked his way through the contract, line by line, disputing all but the most harmless clauses, his behavior just this side of apoplectic.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were finally through, Cecilia was summoned to escort them to the elevator. &#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;he normally doesn&#x2019;t spend that much time with anyone. He must really like you guys.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena turned up the air-conditioning in the car and settled back in her seat. &#x201c;If I needed another excuse to get out of town, that was it. The man&#x2019;s a monster. I&#x2019;ll tell you something&#x2014;Marseille&#x2019;s looking better and better.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s see what Reboul has to say.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t even think of turning him down. I&#x2019;ll twist one arm, and he can twist the other.&#x201d; She leaned across and kissed Sam&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;Resistance will be useless.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Two<br><br></b>Elena and Sam were late as they hurried along the corridor toward the elevator that would take them down to the Chateau Marmont restaurant and dinner with Francis Reboul.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had been delayed by Elena&#x2019;s competitive urge, a desire to wear something that, in her words, would show Reboul that French women weren&#x2019;t the only babes in the world. After several false starts and considerable discussion, she had chosen a dress that was very much the style of the moment: black, tight, and short.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they waited for the elevator to arrive, Sam put his arm around her waist, then allowed his hand to slide gently down to the upper slopes of the finely proportioned Morales <i>derri�re</i>. His hand stopped, moved farther down, stopped again.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Elena,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;are you wearing anything under that dress?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a lot,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A couple of drops of Chanel.&#x201d; She looked up at him and smiled her most innocent smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s that kind of dress, you know? There&#x2019;s only room for me.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Mmm.&#x201d; Sam was saved from further comment as the elevator doors opened to reveal a man wearing a blazer and brick-red trousers, with matching brick-red face. He was holding a half-empty martini glass, which he raised to them. &#x201c;Going to a party out there in the garden,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d get some practice in first.&#x201d; As the elevator came to a stop, he drained his glass, put it in his blazer pocket, straightened his shoulders, and set off, weaving slightly.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboul was already at their table, champagne bucket at his elbow, going through a sheaf of papers. At the sight of Elena he leaped to his feet and took her hand, confining himself this time to a single kiss and a murmured &#x201c;<i>Ravissante, ravissante</i>.&#x201d; Elena inclined her head prettily. Sam rolled his eyes. Their waiter poured champagne.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboul was a man for whom the word dapper might have been invented. Tonight he was resplendent in a black silk suit (the tiny scarlet ribbon of the L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur a nick of color on his lapel) and a shirt of the palest blue. A dazzling white handkerchief, also silk, was tucked into the cuff of his jacket. Like many fortunate Mediterranean men, his skin welcomed the sun, and his smooth, light-mahogany complexion provided a most flattering contrast with his perfectly white, perfectly trimmed hair. Even his eyebrows, Elena noticed, had received the skilled attentions of a master barber. Beneath the eyebrows, his brown eyes twinkled with good humor. He was living testimony to the joys of being rich. &#x201c;A toast,&#x201d; he said, lifting his glass. &#x201c;To the success of our little venture.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam paused, his glass halfway to his mouth. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to spoil the fun,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but I like to know a lot more about my little ventures before I get too excited.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;And so you shall, my dear Sam, and so you shall.&#x201d; Reboul passed the wine list across to Sam. &#x201c;But first, could I ask you to choose some wine for us? I seem to remember that you have an eye for a good vintage.&#x201d; This was accompanied by a raised eyebrow and a conspiratorial nod of the head, as though Reboul were sharing a secret.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the first time he had referred&#x2014;albeit not too directly&#x2014;to Sam&#x2019;s theft of several hundred bottles of the wines he had taken such trouble to acquire. And from his air of general benevolence, and the smile on his face, he appeared to find the incident amusing. Was that really how he felt? Perhaps now was not the moment, thought Sam, to pursue the subject.

This new collection of ``dykes'' follows the politically earnest and neurotic Mo and her affable lover Harriet as they prepare to live together. Their many friends--happily promiscuous Lois; Ginger, the black college professor; Ginger's Asian housemate Sparrow; and lovebirds Clarice and Toni--make appearances through subplots that humorously detail the course of their lives and love affairs. Needless to say, Bechdel's work is politically correct--racially diverse to a fault, her characters routinely spout liberal political platitudes and radical sexual ideology; but her stories combine a gentle humor with a forthright depiction of the complex social issues facing homosexual women. Her drawings are charming, simple and skillfully comic, but the book's real gem is a separate feature, ``Serial Monogamy,'' a very funny, autobiographical examination of the cartoonist's own inability to make a relationship last (``Not only do lesbians have less sex than Hets and Gay men, we break up more often''), something with which heterosexuals can certainly sympathize. <p></p><p>Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Deerskin</h2><p>When her growing beauty begins to resemble her mother&#39;s too closely, Princess Lissar must flee from her father&#39;s wrath, and, in doing so, she unlocks a door into a world of magic.

She lives with her husband, the English writer Peter Dickinson.A first foray into adult fantasy for the author of such well- received children's books as The Outlaws of Sherwood (1988), etc. In an unnamed, standard fantasy kingdom, an unnamed queen dies after bequeathing to her unnamed king a portrait capturing her surpassing beauty. Their daughter, the princess Lissla Lissar, is the very image of her mother, even to her black-red hair. On Lissar's 17th birthday, the king announces that he will marry his daughter! Horrified, Lissar locks herself away, but the king breaks in to beat and rape her. Barely alive, Lissar escapes with her dog Ash to find sanctuary in the mountains. The moon goddess, the ``Lady,'' heals Lissar--suppressing the dreadful memories, changing her hair to white, giving her a stainless white deerskin dress--and four years pass in what seems a day. Now Lissar enters a neighboring kingdom, where she meets the dog-fancying prince Ossin. As she slowly regains her memory, so she falls in love with Ossin, who proposes. Unable to tell him of her past, Lissar again flees into the mountains, returning the following year ready to denounce her father, regain her black-red hair, and marry Ossin. Turgid, lurid, soporific fluff. Might have made an adequate fairy tale at a twentieth of the bulk. McKinley will have to do much better than this to capture an adult audience. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Gleason is shown to be a hard-drinking, hard-living, big spender, whose natural comedy talents are unparalleled but very difficult to live with.

He is the author of more than forty novels and more than a dozen <i>New York Times</i> best sellers, including <i>The Two Swords</i>, which debuted at or near the top of many best seller lists.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Elf ranger Drizzt Do'Urden and his gifted warriors go in search of a missing member of their own band in this latest fast-moving fantasy adventure from bestseller Salvatore (Servant of the Shard, etc.). In the previous episode of the Paths of Darkness series (of the Forgotten Realms umbrella series), Wulfgar the barbarian fought a demon, was possessed and supposedly killed. Now it turns out that not only is he alive but he is in need of the type of assistance at which his friends excel. Getting to Wulfgar and aiding him in his quest for Aegis-fang, his warhammer, is only part of the fun. Drizzt Do'Urden, along with Cattie-Brie, a dwarf named Bruenor Battlehammer and Regis the Halfling, often have to battle the obligatory orcs, goblins and ogres on their way to the real business at hand. A second plot involves the stalking of Drizzt Do'Urden by Le'Lorinel, a Moon elf (or pale elf, whereas Drizzt is a Drow or dark elf). The author combines some of the good versus evil of Robin Hood and his merry men, the campy heroics and friendship of The Princess Bride (including an appearance of dread pirate Sheila Kree) and a rather unfulfilled stab at race relations with Le'Lorinel's unhinged hatred for Drizzt Do'Urden. As this is the fourth novel in the subseries of a larger series, it is not for the uninitiated. Long-awaited by Salvatore's legions of fans, however, this book is as certain as its predecessors to climb bestseller charts. 10-city author tour. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Jerry Uelsmann: Photo Synthesis</h2><p>Photographs create a surrealistic mood by seamlessly combining and overlapping images</p><p>In an enlightening, authoritative foreword to this retrospective collection of Uelsmann's radical photo art, Coleman, who teaches at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, cites photomontages of 19th-century sentimentalists and Dadaists of the 1920s as important precursors to Uelsmann's work--the intermanipulation of two or more pre-imaged negatives to produce a single ``post-visualized'' print. As seen here in seamless cohesion, improbably matched images ``appear integral to the depicted scene.'' In a reverse kinship of form, four hands softly entwined contrast with four rocks suspended and forbodingly separate in mid-air; individual orbed faces are either hand-held or framed in a geographer's globe; a tiny human figure climbs the slope of a tilted drafting-board in a richly paneled chamber open to the sky. Uelsmann's originality is impressive. <p></p><p>Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>George Balanchine&#39;s the Nutcracker</h2><p>Illustrated with photographs taken during the production, this volume features the magical story of the nutcracker and captures the movement, elegance, and artistry of the ballet. Movie tie-in.</p><p>In the manner of Violette Verdy's step-by-step retellings (Of Swans, Sugarplums, and Satin Slippers, 1991), a scrupulously detailed narration explicating what's seen in a full performance of The Nutcracker--in this case, the new film version. The text is written with some grace, though it has the labored visual detail of words following film rather than fiction standing alone. The author's beautifully reproduced color photos, from tiny vignettes tucked into the text to full-bleed spreads, appear in profusion. Some are a bit small to read, and they don't really work together to tell the story, nor do they evoke the movement of the dance as an accomplished illustrator might; but they do convey the lush setting and costumes and the variety of characterizations and actions. Best are the spreads near the end, when the earnest explanations finally cease and the formal configurations of the dance--and the lavish settings--come into their own. An attractive book that will be most useful as a complement to the film. (Nonfiction. 5-12) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her international concert career began in 1987, and she performs regularly worldwide. She lives with her husband and four wolves.A renowned classical pianist, Helene Grimaud explores life with passion, stating, "I have never had the feeling of a paradise lost, but of a paradise to be found." Her islands of bliss are classical music and the sanctuary she created for wolves. Growing up in France, her talent for the piano was evident early on, and at 13 she became the youngest student at the National Conservatory of Music. A determined prodigy who shouldered responsibility for her path even when she stumbled, she shaped her musical gift in her own way. She met her first wolf in Florida, and the intense recognition seemed to be mutual. Grimaud's deep friendship with the wolf and her owner, Dennis, inspired her to establish a wolf sanctuary in upstate New York and to become a wolf advocate. As Grimaud celebrates both the transcendental power of music and the beauty, spirit, and significance of wolves, her eloquent and inspiring reflections embody her love for and total involvement in her work and nature. <i>Pamela Crossland</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His culinary signature is pristinely flavored food made with the freshest seasonal ingredients. <i>Jeremiah Tower Cooks</i> presents 250 recipes for dishes like Chilled Mushroom Soup with Spiced Crab, Ricotta Dumplings with Fava Beans and Savory, and Spiced Duck Sichuan Style. Though dishes like these can demand a shopping and cooking commitment, there's nothing difficult about putting them together. For cooks interested in simple yet refined cooking that veers to the deluxe (Tower's favorite hamburger is made with truffles), this cookbook is a must.<p>Organized by courses and food categories, the book begins, provocatively, with "Delights and Prejudices," a compendium of often-wry observations. (Tower favors using a microwave, for example, but only for reheating food--"[so used] it changes the food less than any other method," he says--but is against the pervasive roasted garlic pur�e, which he finds "indigestible.") Tower is also a culinary reader and dishes like English Autumn Salad (adapted from Robert May's 1685 <i>Accomplisht Cook</i>) and The Anchovy Toasts of Austin de Croze (from his 1931 <i>What to Eat and Drink in Paris</i>), among others, reflect that pursuit. A selection of mostly simple, mostly fruit desserts includes New Summer Pudding, "Burnt" Passion Fruit Curd, and Black Bottom Pie, which Tower says "needs no comment. Or rather, I can't think of any that would do justice to this perfect pie." With many more opinions, and illustrative paintings that are a welcome change from the usual food photography, the book will fill many hours with good reading as well as superior cooking. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Jeremiah Tower is widely recognized as having founded California cuisine when he was chef of Chez Panisse in the 1970s. His first book, New American Classics, won a James Beard award in 1986 for best American regional cookbook. He also won the James Beard award for best chef in 1996 He is the writer and host of the PBS series America&#39;s Best Chefs. Donald Sultan is a painter known for his untraditional takes on the traditional genre of still life. His work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Dallas Museum of Art, among others.</p><h2>Coming to Our Senses</h2><p>Originally published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1989, "Coming to Our Senses" is the second volume in a trilogy on the evolution of human consciousness, and the recipient (in 1990) of the Governor's Writers Award for Washington State. (The first, "The Reenchantment of the World," was published in 1981 by Cornell University Press; the third, "Wandering God," was released in 2000 by the State University of New York Press.) The focus of this particular volume is the relationship between culture and the human body, and the somatic basis of Western religious experience. Whereas the first volume in the series is largely historical, and the third largely anthropological, "Coming to Our Senses" focuses on human psychology, especially the earliest years of life, and how this has historically influenced the nature of adult life and institutions in the West.</p><p>"This is one of the most important books that will be written before the third millennium begins." -- <i>Larry Dossey, M.D.</i><br><br>"[Berman has] stepped beyond intellectual history to become our foremost historian of experience" -- <i>Guy Burneko, World Futures, vol. 30, 1990&nbsp;</i><br><br>"A thought-provoking, boldly original book" -- <i>Alex Raksin, Los Angeles Times, 14 May 1989</i></p><h2>Primitivism in Modern Art</h2><p><p> This now classic study maps the profound effect of primitive art on modern, as well as the primitivizing strain in modern art itself. Robert Goldwater describes how and why works by primitive artists attracted modern painters and sculptors, and he delineates the differences between what is truly primitive or archaic and what intentionally embodies such elements. His analysis distinguishes the romanticism of Gauguin; an emotional primitivism exemplified by the Br�cke and Blaue Reiter groups in Germany; the intellectual primitivism of Picasso and Modigliani; and a &#x201c;primitivism of the subconscious&#x201d; in Mir�, Klee, and Dali. Two of Goldwater's related essays&#x2014;&#x201c;Judgments of Primitive Art, 1905&#x2013;1965&#x201d; and &#x201c;Art History and Anthropology&#x201d;&#x2014;have been added for this new paperback edition. </p></p><p>This book is admirably thorough. Professor Goldwater's approach to the problems involved remains consistently historical, analytical and descriptive...The investigation...is of lively interest and real importance. (Edward Alden Jewell <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>Goldwater's study, first published in 1938, has become a classic in the field of art history. His descriptions of how and why modern painters and sculptors were attracted to primitive art are essential to understanding artists from Paul Gauguin to Paul Klee. (<i>Bloomsbury Review</i>)<br><br>A valuable contribution to contemporary art criticism. (<i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>Goldwater's book...has remained the definitive account of the artistic impact of primitive art on the art of modern Europe. (Hilton Kramer <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>A profound critical analysis...After [his] impressive, objective study, Dr. Goldwater is in a position to define primitivism and indicate its underlying assumptions. (<i>Parnassus</i>)</p><h2>Lost Desserts: Delicious Indulgences of the Past Recipes from Legendary and Famous Chefs</h2><p>With recipes of glamorous by-gone desserts, and packed with history and anecdotes of famous classic restaurants and the people who frequented them, <i>Lost Desserts</i> features delicious and sometimes exotic favorites from the new world and the old. Conjuring up the heyday of Hollywood are such American classics as the Brown Derby&#x2019;s Orange Chiffon Cake, Trader Vic&#x2019;s Flaming Tahitian Ice Cream, and Chasen&#x2019;s Banana Shortcake with Banana Sauce, while the old-world elegance of Paris and London is evoked with delightful concoctions like Escoffier&#x2019;s Mont Blanc and Lady Jekyll&#x2019;s Orange Jelly with Compote. The seventy recipes included here, adapted for the home cook and updated for the modern palate to taste as good as they look and are remembered, are organized by type of dessert, which run the gamut from Bavarians, Cremes, Charlottes, Mousses, Puddings, Fools, Jellies, to Frozen Desserts, and Souffles, Crepes, and Custards, as well as, of course, Cakes and Pies, Tarts, and Tortes. A lavish volume, <i>Lost Desserts</i> is illustrated with thirty stunning still lifes of visually spectacular confections, capturing the flavor and essence of the dessert cart era.</p><p><b>Gail Monaghan</b> is a food writer and editor.

Sometime around midnight I had a strange encounter with an elderly gentleman, who was looking at me with his mesmerizing eyes, surprised that I had sampled bites of at least three dozen of the birthday cakes. Fortunately, I remembered Mark Twain's line and told him, "The secret is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside."<p>What this mysterious person did not know was that during the past couple of decades, I had become a dessert addict, tasting and, mostly, enjoying their flavors.</p><p>What we need today is a book that gives precise and stylish instructions for making sweets our ancestors made and enjoyed. I am happy to say that Gail Monaghan's volume, Lost Desserts, is a brilliant collection. She brings to us practical and contemporary versions of great sweets of yesterday made with today's ingredients and techniques.</p><p>Reading her book reminded me that I learned quite a bit about this sweet subject in Hungary, the country of my birth, where some of the experts claim that the Aztecs shamelessly stole the secret of making chocolate from a Budapest housewife. Even though Hungarian housewives and pastry chefs make memorable desserts, I have a bit of a problem with this Danubian statement.</p><p>A few weeks ago, five friends of ours from the world of restaurants were enjoying our coffee when one of the guests asked us to mention desserts that are truly close to us. I have to admit that dessert names were thrown around without rules to follow, but I recall a few of the names that each of us declared during this session. Here is a list: Charlotte Russe, Chocolate Angel Torte, Dobos Torte, Escoffier's Peach Melba, and Schrafft's Coffee Milkshake.</p><p>The most engaging power of an author or a cook is to make new things familiar and--surprise--familiar things new. When James Beard was asked, "What is the best part of a dessert?" he said, "It is the anticipation." You might start anticipating by reading this great book of Gail Monaghan's recipes.....</p></p><h2>Revolutionary Russia 1891 1991</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Orlando Figes&#39;s books have been translated into 20 languages - they include Crimea, Just Send Me Word, Natasha&#39;s Dance, A People&#39;s Tragedy and The Whisperers. Figes is Professor of Modern History at Birkbeck College, University of London. He is Britain&#39;s foremost writer on the Soviet Union.Russia&#x2019;s experience of the Bolshevik regime appears as a complete historical period in this survey. Figes sets the stage by describing the politics that paved the way for Lenin&#x2014;radicalization of parties and the rigidity of the Romanov autocracy and its collapse under the strains of WWI. Recounting the Reds&#x2019; victory in the ensuing Russian Civil War, Figes underscores that Lenin&#x2019;s governing instruments and attempt to totally eradicate capitalism were not anomalies but essential features of the Communist program. His concession in 1921 to restore a modicum of free enterprise encouraged successive leaders such as Gorbachev to look to the 1920s for the &#x201c;real&#x201d; Lenin, but Figes delineates the weaknesses of the argument. Stalin reached for the real Lenin of the Civil War, who employed mass suppression, dispossession of the peasantry, and state control of industry. Reprising those policies, albeit on a pathologically murderous scale, Stalin cultivated support from the generation he promoted to fill the places of his victims. Bringing the story full circle with the Khrushchev generation&#x2019;s doubts about the Communist system, Figes delivers an exemplary introduction to the Russian Revolution. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>I Spy: A Balloon</h2><p>A Level 1 reader with picture riddles and search-and-find fun!<br><br>All new, easy-to-read riddles by Jean Marzollo are paired with fun photographs culled from previously published I Spy books to create this I Spy easy reader that's perfect for spring!

The ample Adelya stood in the archway from the kitchen to the breakfast room.<br><br>Kharl smiled as he eased back the straight-backed oak chair and stood. He glanced down at the green-trimmed white plate---it was the plain china---on which remained a half slice of egg toast. "More, Adelya? I couldn't finish everything you cooked. It's been a long time since I've eaten so well." That wasn't quite true. He'd eaten that well as Lord Ghrant's guest in Dykaru, but, he reflected, he'd never eaten under his own roof as he had for the last two eightdays.<br><br>He still had trouble believing that he was lord of Cantyl. He'd studied the figures laid out in the ledger by Speltar, the estate steward, and seen and counted the golds in the strong room below. He was wealthy, if modestly so by the standards of lords, and that was something he'd never expected, never dreamed. Not for a man who had been a cooper in Brysta most of his life, and a carpenter's assistant on the Seastag after he'd been forced into exile by Lord West's son Egen.<br><br>From that exile had come all the events---and the magely talents---that had led him to become lord and master of Cantyl and its lands. Cantyl was a modest estate, as estates went, roughly some ten kays by five, with timberlands and vineyards, enough fertile ground to provision the lands, and more than a few rugged and rocky hills. There were a handful of fruit trees on the slope south of the main house, but they were barely an orchard.<br><br>The only things missing were his sons, but he had no way to reach Arthal, and he'd sent a message on Hagen's Seastag, the next ship of the lord-chancellor's merchant fleet scheduled to port in Brysta. It was chancy as to whether his letter would actually reach Merayni in Peachill, where Warrl stayed with his aunt, but Kharl had to try.<br><br>"You be sure you've had enough, ser?" asked Adelya. "The way you've been working, more like a field hand than a lord..."<br><br>"Hard work makes me feel better," Kharl replied.<br><br>"You could have someone---"<br><br>"I'm a better cooper and carpenter than anyone I could pay." Kharl grinned. "And I'm more trustworthy, too."<br><br>Adelya tried not to smile, and failed.<br><br>"Besides, how can I learn about Cantyl if I don't work it?"<br><br>"You sound like Lord Koroh. He was Lord Julon's father."<br><br>Hagen had mentioned in passing that Julon had held the estate before Lord Ghrant, but had not mentioned any details.<br><br>"Good lord, Koroh was." Adelya straightened. "You sure you don't need any more?"<br><br>"I'm most certain." With a smile, Kharl turned and walked from the breakfast room down the rear hall to the south doorway. It was really a service entrance, but it was closest to the small barn that he was converting into his private cooperage. He enjoyed working with wood, and once he received the oak he had ordered, he could begin to make barrels for the vineyard. That would save Glyan, the head vintner, more than a few golds over the course of the year, and it would give Kharl the sense that he was adding to the worth of Cantyl.<br><br>Once outside in the chill sunlight, he walked briskly down the gravel path toward the small barn. Although the first days of spring had been cool for Austra, the heavy sandstone walls of the house had kept it pleasant during the past eightdays as Kharl had worked to learn about his holding, studying the accounts, walking the lands, and building his cooperage.<br><br>Without hesitation, Kharl slid back the barn door and stepped into what had once been a secondary stable. At some point, he'd need to put in a better set of doors, but his first task was to finish removing the remaining stalls.<br><br>For a good two glasses, Kharl worked in the small barn, carefully loosening and breaking down the last of the stall walls, taking out pegs and the occasional nail, so that the planks and cut timbers could be reused. He had three piles in the center of the dirt floor.<br><br>After finishing with the eighth stall, he straightened. Despite the coolness of the day, sweat beaded on his forehead, and he blotted it away with the sleeve of the heavy gray shirt he'd worn as the carpenter's assistant on the Seastag.<br><br>"Ah...ser?"<br><br>Kharl turned to see Speltar, the estate steward, standing in the open doorway. "Good morning, Speltar."<br><br>"That it is, ser. You've been working hard."<br><br>"I can't build a cooperage here until I've got the space ready."<br><br>The steward nodded. "I should have the listing ready this afternoon." He paused. "For the equipment we talked about yesterday."<br><br>"What did we forget?" Kharl grinned. "Or I forgot?"<br><br>"We'd talked about varnish or shellac for the flooring here..."<br><br>Kharl looked at the dirt floor inside the east end of the barn, a space where there had been ten stalls, then glanced to Speltar. "I can't believe there were so many stalls. There were ten here, and there are twenty in the main barn."<br><br>"Lord Julon had four teams," replied the short and slim steward, nervously pushing back his wispy reddish brown hair, not that there was enough to cover his balding pate. "He had four horses to a team, and they weren't used for work around the lands. So we needed stalls for the shire horses, mostly in winter, and stalls for the fancy teams."<br><br>"Where did he drive them?"<br><br>"Oh, he took two teams to Valmurl. One team pulled the carriage most of the way, and then he made his entrance with the other." Speltar cleared his throat. "About the varnish?"<br><br>"What about it?"<br><br>"I was talking to Dorwan about it. He had a suggestion."<br><br>Kharl nodded. He'd already learned that Dorwan never volunteered anything directly to him, but always suggested things to Speltar. The forester, for all his size and bulk, was almost painfully shy, and it would take a while before he was at ease with Kharl---or anyone new to the estate. "It was probably a good one."<br><br>"Yes, ser. You know the flagstone walk in front? Well...years back, Lord Julon had flagstone squares cut, big thick squares, and he was going to have them polished for a summer porch. Ah...the porch never got built. Dorwan says that the flags, more than enough to floor your cooperage anyway, are still there, in the back of the storage shed above the vineyard building. They were smoothed, but never polished."<br><br>Kharl laughed. "Those would be better than a timber floor, especially around the forge." He paused. "I know how to lay a plank floor. I can't say I know how to lay a stone floor that well."<br><br>"Dorwan says his boy Bannat and he can do it. Take less than an eightday. Need some lime for the mortar, but that's a sight cheaper than varnish."<br><br>"Does he have the time, without neglecting what he does in the woodlands?"<br><br>"Still early for poachers, and word's out that Lord Kharl's a mage." Speltar grinned shyly. "Dorwan says that he and Bannat can start leveling and packing the clay underneath tomorrow."<br><br>"What do you think?"<br><br>"Stone'll last longer than wood, ser. We already have the flags. If we have to cut the timbers...all we have is softwood."<br><br>"What you're trying to tell me is that a softwood floor won't last, and that we could sell the good spruce timbers to the carpenters and shipyards in Valmurl for good coins, and besides that, you can get some use out of the flagstones stored in the shed, and free up some storage space."<br><br>"There is that, ser."<br><br>Kharl shook his head. "It's a good idea. We should do it. If I don't see Dorwan today, and you do, tell him that I appreciate his thoughtfulness. I'll tell him, but..."<br><br>"Yes, ser. He's a mite...reserved."<br><br>"Begging your pardon, ser..." came a young voice from behind Kharl. "There's a vessel under steam headed for the pier. Da said you'd want to know, ser."<br><br>Kharl turned to see a dark-haired girl of ten or so---Glyan's daughter Rona. She was the unofficial messenger around Cantyl. "Thank you."<br><br>"Yes, ser." Rona smiled. "Do you want me to tell Da anything?"<br><br>"Not yet. Why don't you come down to the pier with us? That way, if I need you to take a message..."<br><br>"Yes, ser!"<br><br>Kharl and Speltar walked up the rise from the small barn to the main house, then took the graveled lane that led down to the east and to the pier. Rona followed several paces behind. The lane split a large sloping meadow into two sections of roughly equal size---although the grass was still winter brown, with just the barest hints of green showing beneath the dead thatch. The meadows were bordered by stone walls, beyond which, on the south-facing slopes, were the vineyards that produced much of the income from the estate, mainly from the sale of the pale amber Rhynn, considered a desirable wine with poultry and fish by those well-off in Valmurl and Bruel. In the brief time he'd been at Cantyl, Kharl had discovered that he actually liked good wine, and he suspected that his past dislike of wine had not been a distaste for wine but a repugnance for bad wine---and that had been all that he'd ever tasted. Still, a good lager was his favorite.<br><br>The incoming vessel was already well past the harbor mouth and steaming toward the pier, a thin trail of smoke dispersing into the blue-green sky.<br><br>"You weren't expecting a ship?" asked Kharl.<br><br>"No, ser."<br><br>Kharl tried to make out the vessel. It wasn't the Seastag, but with the twin masts, and the midships paddle wheels, it could have been her twin. "Looks like one of Lord Hagen's vessels."<br><br>"Aye," offered Speltar. "Looks much like the Seacat. Captain Druen stops here now and again for timbers, and for the wine."<br><br>Kharl and Speltar reached the pier before the ship, but not before Dorwan and his assistant, the wiry Norgal.<br><br>"You'll be handling the lines?" Kharl asked.<br><br>"Yes, ser," replied Dorwan.<br><br>"Good." Kharl paused. "Dorwan...Speltar told me about your idea for the cooperage floor. Using the old flagstones, that's much better than using softwood. Thank you."<br><br>Dorwan nodded. "My duty, ser."<br><br>"That may be, but I appreciate how well you do it."<br><br>"Thank you, ser." Dorwan turned toward the end of the pier, watching as the vessel approached with bare steerageway.<br><br>When the ship drew within a ten rods or so of the pier, Kharl made out the name under the bowsprit---Seafox. Within moments after making out the name, Kharl recognized Hagen, standing just aft of the bow, wearing the same dark gray jacket he'd often worn as master of the Seastag, rather than the finery of the lord-chancellor of Austra. Why was he coming to Cantyl? Or was he stopping on his way to Valmurl?<br><br>That was unlikely, Kharl thought, because Hagen had been obliged to ride northward from Dykaru with Lord Ghrant in almost a processional return to Valmurl.<br><br>The master of the Seafox backed down the paddle wheels expertly, and the vessel came to rest less than three cubits from the pier. Dorwan and Norgal caught the lines and made them fast to the bollards.<br><br>"Walk her in! Lively now!" came the commands from the deck.<br><br>When the gangway was down, Hagen was the first one onto the water-whitened timbers of the pier.<br><br>Kharl stepped forward, inclining his head to Hagen, out of respect for both the man and the office. "Lord-chancellor."<br><br>"Ser Kharl and mage." Hagen smiled broadly. "No sooner than you're out of sight, and you're back in working grays." He shook his head in mock-despair.<br><br>"I don't see any lord-chancellor's finery on you, ser," Kharl replied.<br><br>"Not in traveling," Hagen said with a laugh. "What's your excuse, ser Kharl?"<br><br>"I was working on turning part of a barn into a cooperage. If we make our own barrels, we can bring in more coins from the wine. We can also save on storage barrels..."<br><br>Hagen shook his head. "Lord Ghrant will be disappointed to hear that his mage has returned to coopering."<br><br>"I can't be a mage all the time, not when matters here are peaceful." Kharl gestured toward the Seafox. "I'm not sure that we have any cargo for your ship." He turned toward the steward. "Speltar? Do we have cargo that should go?"<br><br>"Not right now, ser."<br><br>"That makes us even," replied Hagen. "We don't have anything to off-load, either. Or so I'm told."<br><br>Kharl gestured toward the house. "Would you like to see the house? You haven't seen it before, have you?"<br><br>"No. I wasn't exactly favored by either Lord Julon or Lord Estloch." Hagen's voice was dry. "I'd like to see it. I do need a few words with you, as well. That's why I'm here, but we can talk while you give me a private tour."<br><br>Kharl caught the slight emphasis on private. Of course, Hagen had a reason for stopping in Cantyl. He turned to Speltar. "Speltar, if you and Rona would let Adelya know that the lord-chancellor will be having the midday meal with me. We'll eat in the breakfast room, just the two of us."<br><br>"Yes, ser."<br><br>As Rona and Speltar hurried ahead of them, Kharl and Hagen started up the lane toward the house at a more measured pace.<br><br>After several moments, Kharl glanced at Hagen. "You can stay for a midday meal, at least, can't you? I didn't ask you...I just thought..." His eyes flicked back, but Dorwan and Norgal had remained on the pier.<br><br>"That would be about all," replied Hagen, with a laugh. "Lord Ghrant expects me for tomorrow afternoon's audience." Hagen paused. "He expects you as well."<br><br>"Me?"<br><br>Lord Ghrant had told Kharl his services might be required, but within two eightdays of coming to Cantyl?<br><br>"He has a problem," Hagen said. "The problem is Guillam."<br><br>"The head of the factors' council?" As Kharl recalled, perhaps according to Lyras, the black mage who had claimed he was but a minor mage, if that, Guillam had been quietly backing Ilteron and had slipped out of Valmurl during the revolt.<br><br>"Guillam claims that he is a most faithful subject. For obvious reasons, Lord Ghrant has his doubts. You are known to be a mage, and Lord Ghrant wishes you present when he receives Guillam."<br><br>"He expects I will know if Guillam lies, then?"<br><br>"Will you not? You knew when Asolf was lying about stealing Reisl's coins."<br><br>Again, Kharl was reminded of how thorough Hagen was, and how he had known everything aboard the Seastag. Doubtless, that attention to detail was what had made him the owner of ten ships and lord-chancellor. "I usually can tell."<br><br>"That could be a problem," mused Hagen.<br><br>"That I might not be able to tell?"<br><br>"No. That you could. Let us say that Guillam did support Ilteron. What else can lord Ghrant do but execute or exile him?" Hagen cocked his head, waiting for an answer from Kharl.<br><br>"If he does either, then, that will upset the other factors."<br><br>"All regarded Ghrant as weak."<br><br>"He still is," suggested Kharl. "He has a strong lord-chancellor."<br><br>"And a black mage," added Hagen.<br><br>"So...you are suggesting that my presence is more important than my judgment?"<br><br>"Your presence is most important."<br><br>Kharl realized that. It had to be, with Hagen diverting one of his ships to get Kharl. "Does it matter so much what Guillam has done as what he will do? Does his past matter as much as his loyalty?"<br><br>Hagen fingered his chin, smiling broadly. "So you would have him questioned about both his past and his loyalty?"<br><br>"If he lies about his past, but honestly believes that he is loyal," Kharl said slowly, "Lord Ghrant might overlook his lies."<br><br>"That is possible, but what if Guillam lies about his loyalty?"<br><br>"Then Ghrant is better off if he is dead or exiled, I would judge," Kharl replied carefully.<br><br>"Dead. Traitorous exiles can return."<br><br>Kharl wasn't so sure that he liked having Guillam's lif...</p><h2>Full Fathom Five: A Novel of the Craft Sequence</h2><p><p>On the island of Kavekana, Kai builds gods to order, then hands them to others to maintain. Her creations aren't conscious and lack their own wills and voices, but they accept sacrifices, and protect their worshippers from other gods&#x2015;perfect vehicles for Craftsmen and Craftswomen operating in the divinely controlled Old World. When Kai sees one of her creations dying and tries to save her, she's grievously injured&#x2015;then sidelined from the business entirely, her near-suicidal rescue attempt offered up as proof of her instability. But when Kai gets tired of hearing her boss, her coworkers, and her ex-boyfriend call her crazy, and starts digging into the reasons her creations die, she uncovers a conspiracy of silence and fear&#x2015;which will crush her, if Kai can't stop it first. <br><i>Full Fathom Five </i>is the third novel set in Max Gladstone's addictive and compelling fantasy world of <i>Three Parts Dead</i></p></p><p>MAX GLADSTONE went to Yale, where he wrote a short story that became a finalist in the Writers of the Future competition. He lives in Boston, Massachusetts. <i>Full Fathom Five </i>is his third novel.<p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The idol would drown that night.</p> <p>&#x201c;Death projected for half past one A.M.,&#x201d; ran the memo Kai read at lunchtime on the volcano&#x2019;s break room bulletin board. &#x201c;Direct all inquiries to Mara Ceyla.&#x201d; Another business update among many, pinned between a recruitment ad for the office ullamal league and a pink poster for a lunch-and-learn on soul trading in the Southern Gleb. Few noticed the memo, and fewer read it. Kai did both, and took the news back to her office with her sandwich. Ham and cheese and lettuce on white bread digested easy. The news didn&#x2019;t.</p> <p>Kai ruminated through the afternoon, and dinner, and the night. By 1:00 A.M. her work was done: three chickens sacrificed, one each on altars of silver, iron, and stone; a stack of profit and loss statements dispatched by nightmare telegraph; a prayer litany chanted balancing on one foot; a proposal drafted, suggesting an Iskari family shift their faith from the high-risk personal resurrection market to dependable grain-focused fertility. She scrubbed down the altars, washed her hands, brushed her hair, tied it back in a ponytail, and glanced again at the clock. One twenty.</p> <p>Her office windows faced into the caldera. Two human figures waited on the shore of the dark pool far below, in the pit&#x2019;s center. Kai recognized their outlines, though rendered doll-sized by distance. Gavin, tall, round, peered into the deep. Mara beside him was a straight line with a slight bend at the shoulders; she paced in tight circles, nervous, desperate, already mourning.</p> <p>Kai had long passed quitting time. The Order owed her a carriage ride home. In thirty minutes she could be brushing her teeth, and in five more abed and asleep, safe from everything but dreams.</p> <p>Mara turned. Stopped. Twisted the toe of her shoe into broken lava. Stuffed her hands in her pockets, pulled them out again, crossed her arms, uncrossed them. She walked to the edge of the pool, glanced in, shuddered, retreated.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not my problem,&#x201d; Kai said, and realized she&#x2019;d spoken out loud to her empty office&#x2014;empty, at least, of people. The altars and prayer wheels and rosaries and fetishes and sacrificial knives kept their own counsel, as always. &#x201c;Damn.&#x201d;</p> <p>She walked the long lonely hallway to the break room and descended a winding stair to the caldera floor, to join the death watch. She paused at the foot of the stairs. She could still go. They hadn&#x2019;t seen her yet.</p> <p>Leaving from her office would have been understandable. Leaving now was cowardice.</p> <p>And anyway, Mara needed a friend.</p> <p>Kai stepped out into the night, into view.</p> <p>Cliffs above circumscribed a sky swirled with alien stars. Kai approached over lava five hundred years cool.</p> <p>Mara&#x2019;s feet ground gravel as she turned. &#x201c;You came.&#x201d; Her voice was at once relieved and bitter. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t expect you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How are you holding up?&#x201d; Kai asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; Mara sipped coffee from a white mug marked with the Order&#x2019;s black mountain sigil. Her free hand trembled. She turned the hand palm in, then out, spread her fingers, and watched them shake. She laughed a laugh of dry leaves. &#x201c;I wish it would be over soon. Sooner.&#x201d;</p> <p>Kai wanted to touch the other woman&#x2019;s shoulder, but hooked her thumbs through her belt loops instead.</p> <p>Wind whistled over the crater&#x2019;s jagged lip. Gavin seemed not to have noticed Kai&#x2019;s arrival or overheard their conversation. Bent by the pool&#x2019;s edge, he watched the idol dying within.</p> <p>&#x201c;Waiting is the worst part,&#x201d; Mara said. &#x201c;Knowing I&#x2019;m helpless.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There has to be something you can do.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her laugh was short. &#x201c;I wish.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Your idol just needs a loan. A few hundred souls on credit, to keep her alive until the market recovers.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No one knows when the market will recover, or if. Makes it hard to price a loan.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sacrifice to her, then. We can afford the soulstuff to get her through the next few days.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Shame I&#x2019;m all out of virgins and aurochs. What the hell&#x2019;s the plural of &#x2018;aurochs&#x2019; anyway?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Use the Order&#x2019;s funds. You&#x2019;re a priest. You&#x2019;re allowed.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Jace says no.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Did he say why?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Does it matter?&#x201d; She paced again, in circles. &#x201c;He said no.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Blaming yourself won&#x2019;t help.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Who do you think my clients will blame when their idol dies: The market? Or their hired priestess?&#x201d; She jabbed her thumb against her sternum. &#x201c;The guilt&#x2019;s mine sooner or later. I might as well accept that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Your clients signed off on the trade. They knew the risks.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wonder what it feels like,&#x201d; Mara said after a long silence. &#x201c;Losing half of your soul at once.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Idols don&#x2019;t feel like we do.&#x201d; Kai knew as she spoke that it was the wrong thing to say.</p> <p>Stars glinted in black sky and black pool&#x2014;different stars above and below, not reflections. The shattered ground was a thin shell separating darkness from darkness.</p> <p>Gavin turned from the pool and shuffled toward them over lava pebbles. &#x201c;Won&#x2019;t be long now.&#x201d;</p> <p>Kai replaced him on the shore, leaned over the not-water&#x2019;s edge, and watched the idol drown.</p> <p>She was a wire-frame sculpture of light, flailing in the depths like a fish caught on a line: female in figure, almost human. Wings flared. Goat legs bent against themselves. The suggestion of a mouth gaped in a not-quite-face. Her heart had faded, and the fade was spreading.</p> <p>Other idols swam and shifted around her in the pool. Bright outlines of men, women, animals, and angels danced through invisible currents, tied each to each by silver threads. No threads bound the dying idol. Mara had severed her ties to the rest already, to keep her from dragging them down when she died.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful,&#x201d; Gavin said. He shifted from side to side, and his shadow swayed, long and broad, broken by the ground. &#x201c;And sad. It looks beautiful and sad.&#x201d;</p> <p>The idol stared up into Kai and through her, desperate, drowning, and scared.</p> <p><i>Idols don&#x2019;t feel like we do.</i></p> <p>Kai turned from the pool.</p> <p>Human silhouettes watched from office windows above. Curious enough to observe, callous enough to keep their distance. Kai was being unfair. No. She was tired. The situation, that was unfair. The idol was about to die, and take Mara&#x2019;s career with it.</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d; Kai asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;The file code&#x2019;s forty digits long. I&#x2019;ve called her Seven Alpha.&#x201d; Mara sat on a rock and stared down into her coffee. &#x201c;Jace&#x2019;s secretary already sent me the paperwork. Paperwork, can you believe it? I should have expected, but still. They die, and we fill out forms.&#x201d;</p> <p>Kai shouldn&#x2019;t have come. Should have left early, or lingered over her altars and prayers until the worst was over. One more silhouette watching Mara pace, using distance to shield herself from pain.</p> <p>Mara&#x2019;s despair hurt, as did the fear in the idol&#x2019;s eyes. In Seven Alpha&#x2019;s eyes. Kai ought to be home, swaddled in sheets. She felt swaddled, here. Arms bound to her sides. Helpless. Her own words mocked her: <i>there has to be something you can do</i>.</p> <p>There was.</p> <p>&#x201c;You think they&#x2019;ll fire me tomorrow,&#x201d; Mara said, &#x201c;or let me stay long enough to pack my things?&#x201d;</p> <p>Kai stepped out of her shoes. Sharp stone scraped her soles. She unbuttoned her blouse. Gavin and Mara would stop her if they saw. Especially Gavin.</p> <p>But Gavin wasn&#x2019;t looking. Maybe the silhouettes were, above. Maybe someone was running down the winding stair even now to catch her. She unbuttoned faster. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; Gavin said, behind, to Mara. &#x201c;This could have happened to anyone. Shining Empire debt always goes up in price. Everyone knows that. Knew that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not helping, Gavin.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;One of Magnus&#x2019;s idols failed six months ago, and he was promoted. It&#x2019;s good experience. That&#x2019;s what Jace said. A leader has to know how it feels to lose.&#x201d;</p> <p>Kai heard a rustle of stiff cotton as Gavin reached for Mara&#x2019;s shoulder, and an answering whisper as Mara brushed his hand away. Last button free. The hook on her skirt followed, and the zipper.</p> <p>The idol in the water screamed.</p> <p>All at once, Kai thought. Do not wait, or question. If they see, they&#x2019;ll try to stop you.</p> <p>Do it, or don&#x2019;t.</p> <p>She shucked shirt and skirt, stepped out of the fabric&#x2019;s warding circle, swept her hands above her head, ran three steps to the world&#x2019;s edge, and dove.</p> <p>Mara must have noticed in the last second, too late to do anything but shout: &#x201c;Kai, what the hells are you&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>Black water opened before her, and closed behind her.</p> <p>There are many worlds, and one. A shadow cast is real, and so&#x2019;s the caster, though each is of a different order. Cast a shadow complex enough, and one day it will look up. One day it will tear free from the wall to seek the one who gave it form.</p> <p>What might such a freed shadow feel, tumbling through spaces of greater dimension than its own?</p> <p>Kai fell through the realm of gods and idols, on which rock and light and living flesh float like a raft on a cave lake. Diving, she kicked. Bubbles of reality jellyfished up to the distant surface. She swam deeper.</p> <p>Idols drifted immense around her, sphinxes and chimeras, animals and men and women in lightning outline, planet-sized though they&#x2019;d seemed small from shore. Every one was beautiful, and each terrifying. In their center, Seven Alpha flailed limbs of silver and samite. Sharp teeth glimmered in her open mouth.</p> <p>Down Kai swam, down, the drowning idol nearer now, body large as a mainlander cathedral. One sweep of a hand nearly sliced Kai in half; Seven Alpha was desperate and almost dead, scared as a lamb on the butchering floor, but still, here, strong as a god.</p> <p>The next time the idol clawed in her direction, Kai caught one of the lightning-wires that formed her wrist.</p> <p>Her shoulders jerked in their sockets as the idol&#x2019;s arm dragged her along. She rushed through empty space, and its hidden edges tore her flesh and mind. Around her in the black, paper-thin mouths peeled back lips to bare white fangs. Hungry ghosts, ready to descend. The idol&#x2019;s death called scavengers to whom a soul wrapped in flesh was a chocolate wrapped in foil.</p> <p>Kai could not get Seven Alpha&#x2019;s attention this way. She was a gnat, a flitting nuisance. She needed perspective.</p> <p>She held a piece of the idol&#x2019;s wrist, but that piece moved with the rest of the wrist, and so by holding it she held the wrist itself, and if she held the wrist her hand had to be large enough to hold it, and if her hand was large, then, since the rest of her felt proportional to her hand, the rest of her was also large. Mountainous in fact, and strong, but still struggling against the whirlwind of Seven Alpha&#x2019;s death.</p> <p>Never, ever (Kai&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;d told her when she was four and emerged dripping from the water with a half-drowned boy in tow) grab a drowning man. Death&#x2019;s approach lends strength even to the weak. A drowner, crazed, will pull you with him. Hold back, find a rope or plank or life preserver, and let the poor bastard save himself. Herself. Itself.</p> <p>Seven Alpha kicked Kai in the side and she felt her rib break. The idol cut her, and burned her, as she pulled her into an embrace. Up so close, the idol&#x2019;s face was all geometry, perfect planes and curves. She spasmed in Kai&#x2019;s grip, transformed to fire, to thorn, to stinging jellyfish, to billion-armed insect, and back to woman, final form no less painful than the rest. Goat legs sliced Kai&#x2019;s calves and thighs to the bone. Blood seeped into the water.</p> <p>The idol buried her teeth in Kai&#x2019;s left shoulder. A scream bubbled from Kai&#x2019;s mouth and bloomed, rising. The god-realm&#x2019;s darkness rushed into her lungs. She gagged and felt her body start to die.</p> <p>The idol withdrew her teeth and pressed Kai in flaying embrace as they fell. Worlds&#x2019; weight crushed them together.</p> <p>No time to waste. Kai kissed Seven Alpha on the mouth.</p> <p>Cold tangled her tongue. Hunger caught her. Desperation pulled at her soul. She let it. She gave, and gave, and sank. Her soul surged into the idol&#x2019;s mouth, torn from her by need, an insignificant scrap against Seven Alpha&#x2019;s vast hunger.</p> <p>The idol took Kai&#x2019;s soul, and pulled for more, but there was no more to give. They fell, dying, bound by flesh and spirit. The idol sagged. Anger gave way to loss.</p> <p>Perfect.</p> <p>Kai crafted a contract in her mind, and offered it to the idol. A simple trade: a seven million thaum line of credit, enough to save them both for a while, provided Seven Alpha return as collateral her only asset, Kai&#x2019;s stolen soul. Jace may have forbidden Mara from using the Order&#x2019;s funds to save this idol, but he&#x2019;d said no such thing to Kai.</p> <p>Seven Alpha was about to die. She had no choice but to accept, and save them both. Simple self-preservation.</p> <p>Any minute now.</p> <p>Thought came slow to Kai at such depth, weighed down by dream and deep time. They&#x2019;d fallen so far even acceptance might not save them. Too late, too deep. Stupid. Her spinning mind shuddered, slowed, and soon would stop.</p> <p>Her spinning mind shuddered, slowed, and soon</p> <p>Her spinning mind shuddered,</p> <p>Her spinning mind</p> <p>Her</p> <p><i>Yes.</i></p> <p>A key turned in the lock of the world.</p> <p>Kai&#x2019;s eyes snapped open. Power flooded from her, and her soul flowed back along the contract that now bound her to the idol. Light broke through her skin. Seven Alpha spread her wings, pulled from their kiss, smiled a spring morning. The idol&#x2019;s tarnished heart began to heal, to shine.</p> <p>Kai shook with joy.</p> <p>Then everything went wrong.</p> <p>Arms seized Kai from behind: human arms, fleshy, strong. They pried her from the idol, pulled her back and up. Seven Alpha tried to follow, but slow, too weak to resist the not-water&#x2019;s weight. Kai fought, but the arms did not give. She knew her betrayers by their grip. Mara, slender and corded with muscle, fingernails biting Kai&#x2019;s wrists. Gavin, an immense weight of skin and meat. Jace, too, their master. He was the one who held her neck.</p> <p>&#x201c;Get off!&#x201d; She yanked at their fingers. &#x201c;Let me go!&#x201d; They did not.</p> <p>Seven Alpha fell as Kai rose. The contract that bound them stretched, frayed. Star eyes beneath curling horns stared up at Kai in dumb hope. The idol did not begin to scream until the cord snapped, and water closed in to crush her.</p> <p>Fighting and clawing and biting and bleeding, Kai heard sense inside that shriek. There were words amid the fury and the fear, senseless and mad, impossible words, but words nonetheless.</p> <p><i>Howl, bound world,</i> Kai heard as the idol fell, as she died.</p> <p>Kai cried out in answer, in frustration, in rage. Still they pulled her up, as Seven Alpha dwindled to a distant ship on fire, a cinder, a spark, a star, then gone.</p> <p>Kai&#x2019;s friends dragged her to shore. She screamed them back and lay curled on sharp stone, bleeding, coughing, vomiting dreams. Warmth returned, the shadow bound once again to its wall. Traitor hands wrapped her in a sheet and lifted. Jace held her. His chest pressed through the sheet against the wound the idol&#x2019;s teeth left in her shoulder. Bloody fabric rasped over her wrecked skin.</p> <p>She tried to tear free, but lacked the strength. They carried her from the pool: glass-flat, undisturbed by the idol&#x2019;s death.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; Jace&#x2019;s voice, strong, level, sad, so unlike her father&#x2019;s. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. You&#x2019;re safe.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; was all she said.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Max Gladstone</p></p><h2>National Geographic Prehistoric Mammals</h2><p>Written by one of the world&#39;s foremost paleontologists, Prehistoric Mammals gives children a rare glimpse at a world gone by in a stunningly illustrated, incredibly comprehensive reference book.</p><p><b>Alan Turner</b> (1947&#x2013;2012) was one of the world&#x2019;s foremost paleontologists and a professor in the School of Biological and Earth Sciences at Liverpool John Moores University.

Grade 5-10 - Except for stars such as saber-toothed tigers and woolly mammoths, prehistoric mammals get short shrift when compared to dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and toothy marine reptiles. Therefore it is refreshing to see a colorful compendium of these neglected beasts, ranging in size from the rather insignificant representatives from the Age of Dinosaurs to the ponderous Indricotherium of the Asian Oligocene. Dramatic full-color pictures (many encompassing entire spreads) and captions enhance the brief, informative text. Divided by orders and species, each two- to four-page section contains a time line, fact file, global distribution map (where possible), representative beasts, and those nifty illustrations. A ghostly shadow of a six-foot modern human is offered for scale purposes (for a small creature like Eomaia, for example, only the foot is shown). Primates are included, among them Australapithecenes, Homo erectus, and Homo sapiens. For lovers of the BBC production <i>Walking with Prehistoric Beasts</i>, it's a treasure trove. For students, it's an important source of information.<i> - Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When the Nazis took power, Germany had resolved to develop enough synthetic oil to wage war successfully, even without abundant national oil reserves. For decades, these confiscated German documents remained largely ignored in a United States where petro-geologists and petro-chemists were convinced that oil was a &#x201c;fossil fuel&#x201d; created by ancient decaying biological debris. <br><br>Clearly, big U.S. oil companies had no financial interest in explaining to the American people that oil was a natural product made on a continual basis deep within the earth. If there were only so many fossils in geological time, there could only be so much oil. Big oil could then charge more for a finite, rapidly disappearing resource than for a natural, renewable, and probably inexhaustible one. <br><br><i>The Great Oil Conspiracy</i> explains how Stalin at the end of World War II demanded his petro-geologists &#x201c;dig deeper&#x201d; when petro-scientists in the United States had determined that the Soviet Union, like Germany, lacked national oil reserves. Russia today has challenged Saudi Arabia for the lead in oil production and exportation. Once oil is understood as an abundantly available resource, there is no reason hydro-carbon fuels cannot indefinitely propel the development and production of cheap energy reserves the United States needs to maintain its dominant position in the emerging global economy.</p><p><strong>Dr. Jerome R.

This basic tenet of Edith Stein&#39;s political thought rests on her conviction that humanity is fundamentally one community, precious beyond measure. Differences of race, culture, and language offer us means to grasp the values of life uniquely so that we may share them universally, reaching across all such social boundaries. Stein wrote this treatise in the early days of the Weimar Republic, shortly after the First World War. It sets forth a philosophy of law, government, and administration that is at once idealistic and practical. What is right, Stein argues, does not arise from legislation or litigation or politics. Right relations, as such, are more basic than any institution. Here, too, are Stein&#39;s first serious discussions of religious issues such as quilt, expiation, and freedom of conscience. This is the philosophical work that immediately preceded her decision to be baptized on January 1, 1922. Whether ironically or predictably, Stein was put to death twenty years later by a state that brazenly defied nearly every principle that she had defended in this treatise. In death she bore personal witness to the unity and dignity of the human race. She perished with her people, Jews and Christians alike, at Auschwitz in August 1942.</p><p></p><h2>Gods of Riverworld (Riverworld Saga)</h2><p>Thirty-five billion people from throughout Earth's history were resurrected along the great and winding waterways of Riverworld.

First they made engines for Oldsmobile and then for Ford, who in due course eased them out. The brothers became immensely wealthy, but they made no provision for their heirs to carry on the auto manufacturing firm they built into an industry leader. Both died in 1920. The subsequent history of the family, carefully researched and dramatically related by Latham ( Life with Rose Kennedy ) and Dodge "intimate" Agresta, is one of squandered opportunities, failed marriages and general unhappiness. As the authors aptly put it, the tragedy of the family was that it realized the American dream. Illustrations not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Using the archives of the Anna Thomson Dodge estate for original material, this history of the Dodge family tends to concentrate on the personal and sensational. For the business reader, this book has its moments--especially the early chapters, which focus on the two hard-working, mutually supportive Dodge boys (John and Horace). Their role in the early success of Henry Ford during the infancy of the auto industry is especially fascinating. But mostly the story is of a family, unable to handle their wealth or position and beset by episodes of greed, conspiracy, betrayal, and pettiness. This is more fitting for a shallow TV movie screenplay than the business bookshelf. Not recommended.<br><i>- Gene R.

Illustrated. 391p. Index. Notes. Glossary. References.</p><p>Rupert Sheldrake, Ph.D., is a former Research Fellow of the Royal Society and was a scholar of Clare College, Cambridge, and a Frank Knox Fellow at Harvard University. His other books include <em>A New Science of Life</em>, <em>The Rebirth of Nature</em>, and <em>Seven Experiments That Could Change the World</em>. He lives in London with his wife and two sons.Biochemist Sheldrake maintains that if a pigeon in London learns a new habit, then pigeons everywhere else will automatically show an increasing tendency to learn the same habit. He holds that invisible energy patterns or "morphogenetic fields" surround and shape all atoms, all crystals, all pigeons and all humans. In his astonishing theory, any natural systemwhether insulin molecules, dandelions or societiesinherits a collective memory from all previous members of that group. Experimental evidence for Sheldrake's hypothesis is inconclusive but tantalizing. If true, it would force a radical revision of our understanding of genetics, evolution, memory, learning. Many books on the "new physics" and the paranormal have discussed Sheldrake's ideas, but his own explanation of morphic resonance is the most lucid and exciting account to date. He uses the theory here to suggest how creation myths and rituals connect past and present. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The History of the United States: History 8 for Young Catholics</h2><p>This entirely new Catholic textbook covers the Historical period from the Discovery of America to the 2008 election.

Now Bruce Coville and Laurel Long are reintroducing the charming tale in this glorious picture book version. Laurel Long&#x2019;s paintings are breathtaking and luminous. And as he has done in his retellings of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays, Bruce Coville has masterfully reshaped the sprawling story into a picture book that&#x2019;s fresh, engrossing, and faithful to the intent of the original. This is a tale of a family sticking together through hardship, and of wishes granted just in the nick of time. The race to win the silver skates is well-known, but the mystery of the watch and the missing riches is equally enticing. This is the best kind of fairy tale, and kids will be riveted by its drama. For the winter holidays or anytime, this is a book to cherish.</p><p>Bruce Coville lives in Syracuse, New York.<p> Laurel Long lives in southern California.</p>This striking work is an ideal way to introduce a classic story to a new generation of readers. -- <i>School Library Journal</i></p><h2>Modern Nature: Georgia O&#39;Keeffe and Lake George</h2><p>Although O&#x2019;Keeffe is usually associated with the desert landscape of New Mexico, her professional development as an artist largely occurred during the years she summered at Alfred Stieglitz&#x2019;s family estate at Lake George, in the Adirondack mountains of upstate New York. Modern Nature , the first book to examine O&#x2019;Keeffe&#x2019;s time at Lake George in detail, looks behind the public fa�ade O&#x2019;Keeffe created for herself in her later career, revealing a surprisingly different portrait of this widely mythologized artist. More than sixty colour plates reflect the extraordinary body of work created by O&#x2019;Keeffe at Lake George, and are accompanied by rarely seen photographs by Alfred Stieglitz and members of his circle.

Because of the rapid changes in American society, Abraham Lincoln became president of a divided United States during a period of technological and social revolution. Among the many modern marvels that gave the North an advantage was the telegraph, which Lincoln used to stay connected to the forces in the field in almost real time.</p><p>No leader in history had ever possessed such a powerful tool to gain control over a fractious situation. An eager student of technology, Lincoln (the only president to hold a patent) had to learn to use the power of electronic messages. Without precedent to guide him, Lincoln began by reading the telegraph traffic among his generals. Then he used the telegraph to supplement his preferred form of communication&#x2014;meetings and letters. He did not replace those face-to-face interactions. Through this experience, Lincoln crafted the best way to guide, reprimand, praise, reward, and encourage his commanders in the field.</p><p><em>Mr. Lincoln's T-Mails</em> tells a big story within a small compass. By paying close attention to Lincoln's "lightning messages," we see a great leader adapt to a new medium. No reader of this work of history will be able to miss the contemporary parallels. Watching Lincoln carefully word his messages&#x2014;and follow up on those words with the right actions&#x2014;offers a striking example for those who spend their days tapping out notes on computers and BlackBerrys.</p><p>An elegant work of history, <em>Mr. Lincoln's T-Mails</em> is an instructive example of timeless leadership lessons.</p></p><p><p>Tom Wheeler is managing director of Core Capital and the author of <em>Take Command: Leadership Lessons from the Civil War</em>. He is chairman and president of the Foundation for the National Archives, a nonprofit organization dedicated to telling the American story through its documents, and a former director of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). He lives in Washington, D.C.</p>The Internet has sparked interest in its predecessor, the telegraph (Tom Standage's <i>The Victorian Internet</i>, 1998); here is a case study in the trend. Applying "early adopter" buzzwords to Lincoln, Wheeler's inquiry into his use of the telegraph has the spirit of a management consultant appraising a client's leadership style. The author relates that Lincoln personally sent out 1,000 telegrams during the Civil War, learning along the way what was or wasn't effective. Initially an intermittent user, Lincoln at times was so reliant on rapid communication that he spent nights at the War Department's telegraph office. Every Lincoln reader is familiar with this image, and Wheeler taps into this common memory by quoting Lincoln's telegraphic words on these occasions. They group most numerously around specific battles (e.g., 1862's Second Battle of Bull Run) and Lincoln's reprieves of condemned soldiers. Expanding on this footnote to history, Wheeler shows a Lincoln groping for a best-use of new technology and learning the limitations of the "killer app." <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Continue with the Old Masters by touching the large, lacy collar of Frans Hals&#x2019; The Laughing Cavalier, petting the horse&#x2019;s tail in Velazquez&#x2019;s Prince Baltasar Carlos on Horseback, and arranging the snappy elastic hair in Boticcelli&#x2019;s The Birth of Venus. Other paintings come from Vermeer, de la Tour, Raphael, and Van Eyck.</p><p>PreSchool-K&#x2014;These board books, illustrated with some of the most famous Western masterpieces, encourage children to "touch the art." Each volume draws on a particular period, with <i>Mona Lisa's Hair</i> featuring the work of the Renaissance and <i>Van Gogh's Bed</i> the Impressionists. For each reproduction, a tactile element has been superimposed; for example, an earring on Vermeer's <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> and a piece of tulle on one of Degas' ballerinas. In some cases the feature is small and somewhat hard to find (the fuzz on the peaches in a C�zanne still life, the eyeglasses on the man in Grant Wood's <i>American Gothic</i>), despite the relatively large size of the books. Each selection is identified and accompanied by a brief text. The text of <i>Mona Lisa's Hair</i> is mostly interrogative and less engaging than the other books. It asks, "Do you have a mustache too?" Will children find this silly or condescending? <i>Matisse's Fish</i> opts for a more successful format, with the repetitive refrain of "What a busy day!" <i>Van Gogh's Bed</i> features a lively rhyming scheme, while that in <i>Warhol's Top</i> is more forced (delicious/nutritious/lettuce/messes). The final pages of the books include a date, location, and a description, along with biographical information on the artist for each "artifact." While the idea of introducing children to art at an early age is a noble one, pairing the touch-and-feel format to fine paintings doesn't quite work.&#x2014;<i>Robin L.

The young men were members of Klavern 900 of the United Klans of America. They were seeking to retaliate after a largely black jury could not reach a verdict in a trial involving a black man accused of the murder of a white man. The two Klansmen found nineteen-year-old Michael Donald walking home alone. Hays and Knowles abducted him, beat him, cut his throat, and left his body hanging from a tree branch in a racially mixed residential neighborhood.</p><p>Arrested, charged, and convicted, Hays was sentenced to death&#x2014;the first time in more than half a century that the state of Alabama sentenced a white man to death for killing a black man. On behalf of Michael&#x2019;s grieving mother, Morris Dees, the legendary civil rights lawyer and cofounder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, filed a civil suit against the members of the local Klan unit involved and the UKA, the largest Klan organization. Charging them with conspiracy, Dees put the Klan on trial, resulting in a verdict that would level a deadly blow to its organization.</p><p>Based on numerous interviews and extensive archival research,&nbsp;<em>The Lynching</em>&nbsp;brings to life two dramatic trials, during which the Alabama Klan&#x2019;s motives and philosophy were exposed for the evil they represent. In addition to telling a gripping and consequential story, Laurence Leamer chronicles the KKK and its activities in the second half the twentieth century, and illuminates its lingering effect on race relations in America today.</p><p><em>The Lynching</em>&nbsp;includes sixteen pages of black-and-white photographs.</p></p><p><p><em>The Lynching&nbsp;</em>is the powerful, spellbinding true story of a brutal race-based killing in 1981 and the dramatic two trials during which the United Klans of America, the largest and most dangerous Klan organization in America, is exposed for the evil it represents. <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Laurence Leamer tells a gripping story, weaving in such figures as legendary civil rights lawyer Morris Dees, Alabama governor George Wallace, and Klan Imperial Wizard Robert Shelton, and describes the Klan&#x2019;s lingering effect on race relations in America today.</p><p>The story begins in March 1981, when Henry Hays and James Knowles, members of Klavern 900 of the UKA, picked up nineteen-year-old Michael Donald on the streets of Mobile, Alabama. They were seeking to retaliate after a largely black jury failed to convict a black man accused of murdering a white policeman. Hays and Knowles beat Donald, cut his throat, and left his body hanging from a tree branch in a racially mixed residential neighborhood. Arrested, charged, and convicted, Hays was sentenced to death&#x2014;the first time in more than half a century that the state of Alabama had given that penalty to a white man for killing a black man. </p><p>Morris Dees, the cofounder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, saw the case as an opportunity to file a lawsuit against the UKA. His colleagues told him that his lawsuit was impossible to win and a folly. But Dees had heard that before. On behalf of Michael&#x2019;s grieving mother, Mrs. Beulah Donald, Dees filed a first-of-its-kind civil suit and charged the Klan organization and its leaders with conspiracy. He proceeded to put the Klan leaders on trial, which produced some of the most audacious testimony of any civil rights trial&#x2014;as well as a stunning and precedent-setting verdict. Dees destroyed the UKA and created a weapon that the SPLC used time and again against other racist organizations.</p><p><em>The Lynching</em> is a suspenseful true story that takes us into the heart of darkness, but in the end shows that Michael Donald and other civil rights martyrs did not die in vain.</p><p>Laurence Leamer is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of more than a dozen books, including <em>The Kennedy Women</em> and <em>The Price of Justice</em>.

All the bloody regimes and movements of the 20th century are masterfully captured here, from Stalin's Soviet Union, Hitler's Germany, Mussolini's Italy, and Franco's Spain to the war on terror. With style and sophistication, Michael Burleigh shows how the churches, in their various guises, have been swayed by&#x2013;and contributed to&#x2013;conflicting secular currents. Sacred Causes brilliantly exposes the way in which fears of socialist movements tempered the churches' response to the threat of totalitarian regimes.</p><p> Burleigh combines an authoritative survey of history with a timely reminder of the dangers of radical secularism. He asks why no one foresaw the religious implications of massive Third World immigration. And he deftly investigates what is now driving calls for a civic religion to counter the terrorist threats that have so shocked the West.</p></p><p><p>Michael Burleigh is the author of <em>Earthly Powers</em>, <em>Sacred Causes</em>, and <em>The Third Reich: A New History</em>, which won the Samuel Johnson Prize for Nonfiction. He is married and lives in London. </p>Reviewed by Mark Mazower<p> Perhaps in the United States, with its high rate of churchgoing, the importance of religion is obvious. But in Europe, the impact of faith on public life was, until recently, widely assumed to be in decline. Of course, episodes such as the Roman Catholic Church's alliance with Poland's Solidarity movement in the 1980s highlighted the oddity of thinking that religion was a medieval phenomenon, not a modern one. Yet for decades, theorists of progress predicted that the more societies modernized, the weaker the grip of religion would become: What lay at the end of the road was the inevitable triumph of secularism.</p><p> Quite rightly, Michael Burleigh wants none of this. His Sacred Causes -- a sprawling, uneven and irascible book -- argues that religion never went away. Not only did churches play a role in the resistance (and accommodation) to 20th-century totalitarianism of the Right and Left, but, in Burleigh's view, those ideologies were in fact political religions that borrowed their trappings, rhetoric, dogmatism and fervor from the church. There was, however, a key difference between religious leaders engaging in politics and political leaders demanding religion-like devotion. Christianity, Burleigh says, contributed to Europe's political culture by carving out a space beyond the power of the state. Stalin and Hitler, on the other hand, extended state power into previously private realms. Lethal, fake religions triumphed -- for a time -- over real, humane ones.</p><p> Burleigh defends the Catholic Church in particular. He claims its upper echelons, although inclined to authoritarianism, were more opposed to Hitler than people tend to think. There's no doubt where Burleigh's sympathies lie: Only when he comes to the liberation theology of Latin America, which views Jesus as a liberator of the oppressed, does his anti-Marxism temporarily trump his appreciation for the clergy. But this book is really about Europe. It is silent on political Hinduism in India, Sinhala Buddhist fundamentalism in Asia, evangelical missionaries in Africa and contemporary forms of Jewish nationalism in the Middle East. On Islam, it reproduces the apocalyptic slurs of post-9/11 punditry. While Burleigh does have plenty to say about the battle between religion and secularism on the Old Continent after 1945, little of it is positive. The Protestant churches -- full of their German hand-wringers and English do-gooders -- do not generally elicit from him the same understanding as the papacy, and in his account the sufferings of Orthodox Christianity under communism are counterbalanced by the fascist sympathies of the Romanian clergy. Northern Ireland is portrayed in the spirit of a plague on both houses.</p><p> One notices these things because Burleigh is nothing if not opinionated. He despises "sneering secularists" but is a considerable sneerer himself. Targets include "humanist radical eggheads," "tenured radicals" who take a "vampiric interest in female students," the "horde of bodgers and shysters" in the English construction trades and "dingy Irish theme pubs" with their "relentless, mindless gabbling." As the book moves on, jibes and bile clog the writing, and one has the sinking feeling of being cornered by the pub bore, ranting on about '60s swingers, the threat to European civilization, terrorists and trade unions -- pretty much everything and everyone except the pope, Ronald Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher. I would like to think that the old Burleigh, the fine historian who wrote some superb works on Nazism, is not gone. Maybe this lament for the disappearing "Christian Constitution of Britain" is really a tasteless spoof designed to show the reader where a certain kind of religious despair can leave you. Or perhaps it is simply what he thinks.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

There is more practical wisdom, common sense and sage advice packed within these pages than with any other book of similar size, or content.&#39; This complete and unabridged edition of Spurgeon&#39;s great work will make it possible for today&#39;s generation to appreciate Spurgeon&#39;s combination of discerning wit and refreshingly practical advice. Included in the twenty-eight chapters of this classic volume are lectures such as: - The Call to Ministry - The Preacher&#39;s Private Prayer - On the Choice of a Text - On the Voice - The Holy Spirit in Connection with Our Ministry - The Blind Eye and the Deaf Ear - On Conversion as Our Aim - Illustrations in Preaching As were all of Spurgeon&#39;s messages to his people, each of these lectures is Scripture-saturated and Christ-honoring. They move swiftly and are fascinating in their content and sage counsel.<b>Charles Haddon Spurgeon</b> (1834-92) served for 30 years at the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London. It is estimated that during his lifetime he preached to 10 million people. His collected works (which were translated into numerous languages even in his lifetime) fill over 60 volumes and remain one of the best-selling writing series in history.

It was the worst stock market crash since the Great Depression.<br><br>Landmark events had taken place in recent weeks that had heralded the collapse of the house of cards. Twenty-six days earlier, Lehman Brothers, one of the oldest and most respected investment banks, had filed for bankruptcy, stunning the financial world. Even more stunning was the government&#x2019;s refusal to bail them out, although six months before they had done so for Bear Stearns, which had been bought by JPMorgan Chase. Just before Lehman Brothers&#x2019; historic announcement, Bank of America had announced that it was acquiring equally venerable and respected Merrill Lynch. Investment banks and financial institutions were staggering like drunks all over Wall Street, and several smaller banks had already closed. And the day after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, the largest insurer in the nation lost 95 percent of its value, and six days later was removed from the Dow Jones.<br><br>And with everyone reeling over alarming daily announcements, Whitman Broadbank, the investment bank where Peter McDowell worked and had established his meteoric career, announced that they were folding as well. Peter had been told three days before, as the stock market continued to plunge. It was hard to wrap his mind around it, as he leaned his head against the boxes on his desk. That afternoon at six o&#x2019;clock, they were closing their doors. Peter&#x2019;s golden career, and famously high-risk investments, with previously outstanding results, were no more. He was putting whatever he had left in his office in boxes. He had told his wife, Alana, and their boys, Ryan and Ben, the night before.<br><br>&#x201c;What does that mean, Dad?&#x201d; Ryan had asked him with a look of panic. He was fourteen years old. Peter didn&#x2019;t dare read off the litany of things that were about to change for them all. Everything had to be sold. The firm had been leveraged to the hilt. The stock that Peter had gladly acquired in lieu of profits or salary on many occasions, and that consisted of most of his personal fortune, was worthless paper now. The house in the Hamptons was history, the time share of a plane, their penthouse on Fifth Avenue, private schools, credit cards, the Ferrari he played with on the weekends and the boys loved to ride in, Alana&#x2019;s Bentley, and the brand-new Rolls. All were expensive unimportant toys and symbols of his success. More important, all of their security and way of life had evaporated into thin air. His money and investments were all in Whitman Broadbank, and whatever else he had had gone down the drain with the stock market collapse in the past five days. There was virtually nothing left, or so little that it hardly counted. Peter couldn&#x2019;t think of a single area of his life that wouldn&#x2019;t be affected by what had just happened to the economy, except his marriage and his boys. Alana had been painfully silent and watched him, as he explained it all to them. But even Peter didn&#x2019;t fully understand it yet. No one did. The day before, Iceland had declared the country bankrupt and closed its stock market, and other countries around the world were watching in panic, as they saw the American stock market fall and implode.<br><br>Peter finally managed to tear his eyes from the screen that had mesmerized him all week. His secretary had already left that morning, and there was silence in the halls. Others were doing what he was, loading a few personal things into boxes, and carrying them downstairs. All of them were facing the demise of their careers and radically changed lives as a result.<br><br>Peter stood up and dropped one of the boxes in the doorway. It was hard to imagine now what he was going to do about work. People were getting fired left and right, and there were hundreds of overqualified candidates for whatever jobs remained. In the musical chairs of the financial game, thousands had wound up without a seat, and Peter was no better off than the rest. His success had been extraordinary for the past 21 years, since he hitched his wagon to the star of Whitman Broadbank fresh out of business school when he was twenty-five. Now he was forty-six, virtually broke, and out of a job, and so was almost everyone he knew, with the exception of the lucky few who had survived the tidal wave of the past month. No one he knew had been untouched.<br><br>Peter had been famous for years, with almost every deal he made, but not this time. This time he had taken a fall with all the rest. His luck had finally run out. This wasn&#x2019;t the way he had expected his career to end, but it wasn&#x2019;t over yet; he wasn&#x2019;t about to give up. He was ready to do whatever it took to clean up the mess, tighten his belt, and he knew that sooner or later he&#x2019;d be back. He just didn&#x2019;t know when, or how to accomplish it yet. And for now things were going to be tough. He had warned Alana and the boys of that. They were putting both the house in the Hamptons and the apartment in New York on the market that weekend, although real estate prices had already been hit, and were going to experience a severe drop. He would take whatever they could get. And as soon as the New York apartment sold, he was going to have to figure out where they were going to live. He knew that as long as the family stuck together, they&#x2019;d be all right.<br><br>They had to get past this terrifying time and figure out what to do, and where to go from here. He&#x2019;d been thinking that he could get a job in a small local bank, somewhere outside New York, and make a comeback on Wall Street when the economy was healthy again. He had grown up in a small Massachusetts town, and realized he might have to leave New York for a while and start from scratch. He had lain awake every night all week, thinking about it. All he had left now was a lot of worthless stock, and whatever cash they had on hand, which wasn&#x2019;t much.<br><br>He had insisted that Alana let their live-in couple go earlier that week. They didn&#x2019;t have a penny to spare. The couple had been nice about it and said they understood, several of their friends were in the same situation. And they&#x2019;d been smart enough to keep their savings liquid in the bank. He smiled to himself, thinking that their housekeeping couple were probably in better financial shape than he was right now. He had tried to get them to invest their money, and they&#x2019;d said they didn&#x2019;t trust any bank or investment services. Everything they had was in cash. And cash was king right now.<br><br>Peter rode down in the elevator carrying two of his boxes, with two junior partners, one of whom looked as though he were about to cry. Like most of them, he had been wiped out. Partners and employees who had been on top of the world only a few months before were now back to square one. Peter called it the Chutes and Ladders of life. One minute you&#x2019;re way up at the top, in the stratosphere, and the next minute you&#x2019;re down at the bottom, flat on your ass. It had never happened to Peter before.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give up, Marshall,&#x201d; Peter said to one of the men. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going back to Ohio,&#x201d; the junior partner said, looking depressed, &#x201c;to work for my dad at his factory. All I had was Broadbank stock.&#x201d; It was the situation that most of them were in. And even those who had other stocks knew they were worthless now.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all in the same boat,&#x201d; Peter said, determined to be positive about it, although he had given in to panic himself many times in the last week, in the dark of night. But there had to be a light at the end of the tunnel eventually, even if they were going down the tubes right now. He refused to be beaten by this. It was bad, but it had to get better again at some point.<br><br>Peter left them with a nod on the ground floor. He put the two boxes in the back of the car he had parked outside. He was using the Volvo station wagon that their couple used to drive to do errands for them. He was planning to take his other cars to a fancy used-car lot for high-end cars that weekend. There was going to be a glut of fancy cars on the market, but whatever he got for them was good enough. He had listed his Ferrari on the Internet that week. And Alana had cried when he told her she had to give up her Bentley. There was no room in their life for luxuries right now.<br><br>He brought down four more boxes, and looked at his office for a last time, wondering when he would have a palatial office like this again. Maybe never. Maybe he&#x2019;d never be back. Maybe it really was all over, as everyone feared. He felt a wave of terror wash over him and then turned around and walked out. He stopped to see two of his partners, but everyone he wanted to say goodbye to was already gone. There would be meetings in the coming weeks about their bankruptcy proceedings, but for now, everyone was leaving the sinking ship and worrying about themselves.<br><br>Peter was silent as he rode down the elevator for the last time. He was a tall, athletic-looking man, who appeared younger than his years. He played a lot of tennis on the weekends, worked out with a trainer in the gym he had had built in the apartment, and he was slim and fit. There were a few strands of gray in his sandy blond hair, but it didn&#x2019;t show. He looked like the perfect all-American boy next door. All his life, or at least in recent years, he had been the image of the Golden Boy. For years now, he had embodied success. That hadn&#x2019;t been the case in his youth, when he felt like a screw-up, and had been treated like one. He had been labeled the family black sheep, compared to his perfect fraternal twin brother, whom his parents had revered.<br><br>Peter had been every parent&#x2019;s nightmare, a bright, handsome boy who did abysmally at school and was constantly in trouble, suspended or on probation, either for his behavior or his appalling grades. Undiagnosed dyslexia had nearly destroyed his youth. His classmates called him stupid, teachers got frustrated with him and eventually gave up, and neither Peter nor his parents could understand his difficulties at school. His parents were educated and intelligent, and Peter appeared to be smart, but he was always accused of not trying, being lazy, and was punished for homework assignments he didn&#x2019;t complete. And even he couldn&#x2019;t explain why the letters on the page and the directions he was given made no sense. He punished the boys who made fun of him, with his fists. It was common for him to come home from school with a torn shirt and a black eye, and having delivered worse, while in the lower grades. In high school he took on an attitude of indifference, hostility, and arrogance to cover the sense of failure and incompetence he felt.<br><br>And all the while, his brother Michael was exemplary in every way. He wasn&#x2019;t as good looking as Peter, or as dazzling in some ways. He was shorter, stockier, quieter, and didn&#x2019;t have Peter&#x2019;s looks. Their mother always said that Peter could have been a star if he would just do his homework and behave himself. Michael was always solid and polite, dedicated to his schoolwork, and got outstanding grades. They never had to worry about Michael. It was Peter who nearly broke their hearts every time he failed again. And Michael was always quietly on the sidelines, pointing out Peter&#x2019;s inability to do what was expected of him, or control himself. Michael goaded Peter to lose his temper, whenever no one was watching, and on the rare occasions when Michael did something he shouldn&#x2019;t have, he saw to it that Peter got the blame. It was easy for their parents and teachers to believe that Michael was innocent and Peter the guilty party. By the time they finished high school, Peter&#x2019;s parents were in despair over him. His childhood tantrums had turned into adolescent rages, based on the intolerable frustration he had lived with for eighteen years. He couldn&#x2019;t win his parents&#x2019; approval, or anyone else&#x2019;s, so he had given up trying to win it or do anything he should. He and his brother were staunch enemies by then, and Peter saw him as the cause of many of the ills that plagued him, or even most of them. Peter could never measure up to him. And all of them were astonished when Peter got into college. He had one dedicated high school teacher who had written an extraordinary recommendation for him, insisting that beyond his poor grades and checkered school career was a remarkably bright, creative young man who would one day overcome his problems. He called him a &#x201c;late bloomer,&#x201d; which was the kindest thing anyone had ever said about him, and assured the college that had accepted him that he would make them proud one day.<br><br>And once in college, Peter&#x2019;s entire life had changed. An English professor had taken a profound interest in him, sensed that his earlier poor grades were not due to laziness, and had sent him for sophisticated testing at the learning center. Like a specter in the mists that no one had previously suspected or seen, the dyslexia that had caused him so much pain emerged and was diagnosed. The English professor who had sent him for testing became his mentor and tutored him personally for all four years. The results had been re�markable, and Peter himself was astounded at what he was able to accomplish.</p><h2>The Holocaust in American Life</h2><p>An award-winning history scholar explores the impact of the Holocaust in American political and cultural life, examining its role as a moral reference point for all Americans and the ways in which Jews have used it to define a distinctive identity for themselves. Tour.</p><p>In the first decades following World War II, Americans rarely discussed the Holocaust. Now, remembering the Holocaust has become a fundamental part of Jewish identity; gentiles, too, view the Holocaust as a touchstone of moral solemnity. In <i>The Holocaust and American Life</i>, Peter Novick asks why, and his answers are both sensible and shocking. He explains the immediate postwar silence about the Holocaust by reviewing the basics of cold war politics: just after the liberation of the concentration camps, Americans were called upon to sympathize with "gallant Berliners" who resisted the Soviets and built a wall against Communism--an "enormous shift from one set of alignments to another," Novick notes. Novick then leads readers through the series of events that brought the Holocaust to the forefront of American consciousness--the trial of Adolph Eichmann, the Six-Day War, the Carter administration's Israel policy, and the construction of the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. <p> Among Novick's most controversial ideas is his assertion that American Jews spoke softly of the Holocaust at first because they didn't want to be seen as victims; later, Jews decided that victim status would work in their best political interest. Or, as Novick puts it, "Jews were intent on permanent possession of the gold medal in the Victimization Olympics." <i>The Holocaust in American Life</i> is as carefully researched and argued as it is polemical and probing. Novick does not suffer Holocaust deniers lightly, and he is empathic toward victims and survivors, but he has no tolerance for false sentiment. One wishes that more people would ask, as Novick does, what kind of a country would spend millions of dollars on a museum honoring European Jewish Holocaust victims instead of a monument to its own shameful history of black slavery. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>Peter Novick is professor of history at the University of Chicago. He is the author of The Resistance Versus Vichy and That Noble Dream: The Objectivity Question and the American Historical Profession, which won the American Historical Association&#39;s prize for the best book of the year in American history.</p><h2>Primary Mathematics 3B Tests (Standards Edition)</h2><p>This series is aligned with the standards adopted by the California State Board of Education and follows the topical arrangement in the Primary Mathematics Standards Edition Textbooks.

It includes an introductory description of the setting in which it was preached by the Buddha; the main body of the text, which treats the five factors that constitute a Buddha land, i.e., the Pure Dharma Realm and the four wisdoms: mirror wisdom, equality wisdom, discernment wisdom, and duty-fulfillment wisdom; and a concluding section of two illustrative similes and four summary verses.</p><p>The overall theme of these texts is that the Pure Land is not a physical location, but a symbol of the mind of wisdom - constituted by the five factors of the Pure Dharma Realm and the four wisdoms. These four wisdoms, grounded in the Pure Dharma Realm, present the varied structure of wisdom as conceived by Yogacara thinkers. Mirror wisdom and equality wisdom are nondiscriminative, while discernment wisdom and duty-fulfillment wisdom distinguish the nature of bodhisattva tasks and carry them out in the world. Thus the overarching context for these texts is the tension created between the critical awareness and "deliteralization" tendency of Yogacara, and the Pure Land cultus, with its veneration of many Pure Land Buddhas and its hopes of being born in the Pure Land.</p></p><p>The BDK English Tripitaka Series was started by the late Rev. Dr. Yehan Numata, founder of the Bukkyo Dendo Kyokai (BDK) [Society for the Promotion of Buddhism]. The goal of this series is to make available in the English language the Buddhist scriptures and commentaries of the Sino-Japanese edition of the &#34;Taisho Tripitaka.&#34; Scholars and specialists from throughout the world have been enlisted to translate the selected texts into English. When completed, the one-hundred eight volumes will comprise the First Series of the BDK English Tripitaka.</p><h2>When I&#39;m Feeling Sad</h2><p>But it can often help to talk to someone about it.

It's impossible to escape the past, however, and everyone has their own idea of what it means to be a hero....</li> <li>After a phenomenal success on Kickstarter, Brennan Lee Mulligan and Molly Ostertag bring their popular webcomic into print, collecting the first four issues, as well as some all-new, full-color pages!</li></ul></p><p><b>Brennan Lee Mulligan</b> is a writer, actor and improviser based in Los Angeles.

She has a perfect cat, is a snappy dresser, and can cook a great steak.Gr 10 Up&#x2014;Alison Green, aka Mega Girl, lives in a dark world fraught with difficult relationships. She is a biodynamic, who, along with other young people who possess special capabilities, rejects her role as a superhero and attempts to revert to the life of a "normal" college freshman. However, because she retains her extraordinary abilities, she encounters situations that test her resolve to no longer use her powers. Good versus evil, the possibility of world change, and the worth of an individual life are among the deep and complex concepts explored in this volume. Ostertag's emotion-filled images and expressive faces draw readers into the world created with realistic black-and-white line drawings and an occasional full-page color panel. A narrator speaks directly to readers via footnotes at the bottom of each page. While sometimes interesting and necessary to understand Alison's backstory, at times these comments become annoying and disrupt the flow of the story. Due to the ongoing nature of the webcomic in which Mega Girl first appeared (strongfemaleprotagonist.com), some of the book's story line and characters are not fully realized. Aspects of the book, such as the heavy infusion of profanity, make this title more appropriate for older teens. An exploration of similar issues can be found in Faith Erin Hicks's The Adventures of Superhero Girl (Dark Horse, 2013), in which a female protagonist has to negotiate supernatural and mundane worlds. VERDICT This graphic novel for mature young adults might create new fans for the webcomic, but will leave most readers unsatisfied.&#x2014;Barbara M.

Drugs, sex, murder--all those big-city crimes have their counterparts in the Green Mountain State, and Mayor's fictional police officer, Lieutenant Joe Gunther, is no Andy Griffith of Mayberry. In <i>Bellows Falls</i>, hard-boiled Gunther finds himself up to his neck in spousal abuse, sexual debauchery, teen crime, police corruption, and cold-blooded murder as he investigates a seemingly simple case of sexual harassment. Forget the cheddar cheese and maple syrup--visitors to Archer Mayor's Vermont get a close-up view of rural New England's dark side.Archer Mayor is the author of the highly acclaimed Vermont-based series featuring detective Joe Gunther, which the <i> Chicago Tribune </i> describes as &#x201c;the best police procedurals being written in America.&#x201d; He is a past winner of the New England Independent Booksellers Association Award for Best Fiction&#x2015;the first time a writer of crime literature has been so honored. In 2011, Mayor&#x2019;s 22nd Joe Gunther novel, TAG MAN, earned a place on <i> The New York Times </i> bestseller list for hardback fiction. <br> Before turning his hand to fiction, Mayor wrote history books, the most notable of which, <i> Southern Timberman: The Legacy of William Buchanan, </i> concerned the lumber and oil business in Louisiana from the 1870s to the 1970s. This book was published in 1988 and very well received; it was republished as a trade paperback in 2009. <br> Archer Mayor is a death investigator for Vermont&#x2019;s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, a detective for the Windham County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office, the publisher of his own backlist, a travel writer for AAA, and he travels the Northeast giving speeches and conducting workshops. He has 25 years of experience as a volunteer firefighter/EMT. Mayor was brought up in the US, Canada and France and had been employed as a scholarly editor, a researcher for TIME-LIFE Books, a political advance-man, a theater photographer, a newspaper writer/editor, a lab technician for <i> Paris-Match Magazine </i> in Paris, France, and a medical illustrator. In addition to writing novels and occasional articles, Mayor gives talks and workshops all around the country, including the Bread Loaf Young Writers conference in Middlebury, Vermont, and the Colby College seminar on forensic sciences in Waterville, Maine. <br> Mayor&#x2019;s critically-acclaimed series of police novels feature Lt. Joe Gunther of the Brattleboro, Vermont, police department. The books, which have been appearing about once a year since 1988, have been published in five languages (if you count British), and routinely gather high praise from such sources as <i>The New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New Yorker,</i> and others, often appearing on their &#x201c;ten best&#x201d; yearly lists. <br> Whereas many writers base their books only on interviews and scholarly research, Mayor&#x2019;s novels are based on actual experience in the field. The result adds a depth, detail and veracity to his characters and their tribulations that has led <i>The New York Times</i> to call him &#x201c;the boss man on procedures&#x201d;.</p><h2>Healing with the Fairies Oracle Cards: Booklet and 44-Card Deck (Large Card Decks)</h2><p>Fairies are nature&#39;s powerful guardian angels, and they can miraculously assist you with your self-esteem, relationships, health, and career.

There were days on which nothing of any consequence took place&#x2014;these were in a clear majority&#x2014;and then there were those on which rather too much happened. On those uneventful days you might well wish that a bit more would happen; on days when too much occurred, you longed for life to become a bit quieter.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had always been like that, she thought, and always would be. As her father, the late Obed Ramotswe, often said: there are always too many cattle or too few&#x2014;never just the right number. As a child she had wondered what he meant by this; now she knew.<br> &nbsp;<br> Both sorts of day started in much the same way, with the opening of her eyes to the familiar dappled pattern made by the morning sun on the ceiling above her bed, an indistinct dancing of light, faint at first, but gradually becoming stronger. This intrusion of the dawn came from the gap between the curtains&#x2014;the gap that she always intended to do something about, but did not because there were more pressing domestic tasks and never enough time for everything you had to do. And as long as curtains did their main job, which was to prevent nosy people&#x2014;<i>unauthorised people, </i>as Mma&nbsp;Makutsi would call them&#x2014;from looking into her bedroom without her permission, then she did not have to worry too much about their not meeting in the middle.<br> &nbsp;<br> She woke up at more or less the same time each morning, thought for a while about getting up, and then rose, leaving Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni still deeply asleep on his side of the bed, dreaming about the sort of things that mechanics, and men in general, dream about. Women, she felt, should not enquire too closely as to what these things were, as they were not the sort of things that women liked very much&#x2014;engines and football, and so on. A friend had once said to her that men did not dream about things like that&#x2014;that this was just what women <i>wanted</i> men to dream about, while men, in reality, dreamed about things that they would never reveal. Mma Ramotswe doubted this. She had asked Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni one morning what he had dreamed about and he had replied: &#x201c;the garage,&#x201d; and if this were not proof enough, on another occasion, when she had woken him from the tossing and turning of a nightmare, he had replied to her question about the content of the bad dream by saying that it had all been to do with a seized-up gearbox. And then there was Puso, their foster child, who had told her that his dreams were about having a large dog that chased away the bullies at school, or about finding an old aeroplane in the back yard and fixing it so that it could fly, or about scoring a goal for Botswana in a soccer match against Zambia, with the whole stadium rising to its feet and cheering him. That, she thought, settled that. Perhaps there were some men who dreamed about other things, but she felt that this was not the case for most men.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once up and about, clasping her cup of freshly brewed red bush tea in her hand, she took a walk around the garden, savouring the freshness of the early morning air. Some people said that the air in the morning had no smell; she thought they were wrong, for it smelled of so many things&#x2014;of the acacia leaves that had been closed for the night and were now opening at the first touch of the morning sun; of a wood fire somewhere, just a hint of it; of the wind, and the breath that the wind had, which was dry and sweet, like the breath of cattle. It was while she was standing there that she decided whether the day would be one in which things might happen; it had something to do with the way she felt when she considered the day ahead. And most of the time she was right, although sometimes, of course, she could be completely wrong.<br> &nbsp;<br> On that particular morning as she walked past the mopipi tree she had planted at the front of the garden, she had a sudden feeling that the next few hours were going to be rather unusual. It was not a disturbing premonition&#x2014;not one of those feelings that one gets when one fears that something is going to go badly wrong&#x2014;it was more a feeling that something interesting and out of the ordinary lay ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> She remarked on the fact to Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni as he sat at the kitchen table eating the brown maize porridge that he liked so much. Puso and his sister, Motholeli, had already eaten their breakfast and were in their rooms preparing to leave for school. The school run that Mma Ramotswe had become so used to was now no longer necessary, as Puso was of an age to make his own way there&#x2014;the school was not far away&#x2014;and he was also able to help his sister with the wheelchair. This gave the children an independence that they both enjoyed, although departing on time could be a problem when Puso had some boyish task to complete&#x2014;the catching of flying ants, for instance&#x2014;or Motholeli had at the last minute to find another pair of cotton socks or locate a book that needed to be returned to the school library.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have a feeling,&#x201d; announced Mma Ramotswe, &#x201c;that this is going to be a busy day.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni glanced up from his porridge. &#x201c;Lots of letters to write? Bills to send out?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma Ramotswe shook her head. &#x201c;No, we&#x2019;re up to date on all of those things, Rra. Mma&nbsp;Makutsi has been busy with her filing, too, and everything is put away.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lots of clients to see, then?&#x201d; He thought of his own day and imagined a line of driverless, impatient cars, each eager for his attention, their horns honking to attract his notice: cars, in his view, were quite capable of all the human emotions and failings, including a lack of patience or restraint.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma Ramotswe had looked at her diary just before leaving the office the previous day and had seen that it was largely empty. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;There are no appointments with clients. Nothing this morning and nothing this afternoon, I think.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He looked puzzled. &#x201c;And yet it&#x2019;s going to be a busy day?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have that feeling. It&#x2019;s difficult to say why, but I am sure that this will not be a quiet day.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni smiled. People talked about the intuition of women, but he was not sure that he believed in it. How could women possibly know things that men did not know? Was their hearing more acute than men&#x2019;s, so that they heard things that men missed&#x2014;as dogs or cats might pick up frequencies audible only to them? He thought not. Or was their eyesight more acute, so that they saw clear details where men saw only indistinct blurs? Again, he thought not. What we knew, we knew from our senses, and the senses of women were no different from the senses of men.<br> &nbsp;<br> And yet, and yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As he returned to his porridge, Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni reflected on how there had been so many instances in which Mma Ramotswe had shown a quite uncanny ability to notice things that he himself had simply missed, or to know things about others that most people&#x2014;most ordinary people, or men, to be specific&#x2014;would not be expected to know. He remembered how, while out shopping with her a few weeks earlier, she had whispered to him that a woman walking towards them was probably one of Mma&nbsp;Potokwane&#x2019;s cousins. He had cast an eye discreetly over the woman and wondered whether he had ever met her in the company of Mma&nbsp;Potokwane, but decided that he had not. How, then, could Mma Ramotswe tell?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She was carrying one of those bags that the orphans make in Mma&nbsp;Potokwane&#x2019;s craft workshop,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the first thing I noticed. Then I saw the shoes that she was wearing. They were very unusual shoes, and I had seen them before&#x2014;when they belonged to Mma&nbsp;Potokwane. She must have passed them on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He had dismissed this as fanciful, but several days later, when he had gone out to the Orphan Farm to attend to one of the vans, on a pro bono basis of course, he had remembered the incident and asked Mma&nbsp; Potokwane whether she had any cousins visiting her. She did. And had she passed on an unusual pair of shoes to this cousin? &#x201c;As it happens,&#x201d; said Mma&nbsp; Potokwane, &#x201c;I did. But let&#x2019;s not waste time talking about these small things, Rra. Now there is something wrong with the spare van too, and I was hoping that you would have the time to look at that one as well.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He had sighed. &#x201c;I am always happy to help you, Mma&nbsp; Potokwane,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But there are places called garages, you know, and they are there to fix vehicles. That is their job. Perhaps you might try in future to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma&nbsp; Potokwane did not let him finish. &#x201c;Oh, I know all about garages,&#x201d; she said lightly. &#x201c;But I would never go to one of them&#x2014;your own garage excluded, of course, Rra. Ow, those garages are expensive! You drive onto their forecourt and straightaway that&#x2019;s two hundred pula. You get out of the car&#x2014;that&#x2019;s another fifty pula. They say, &#x2018;Good morning, Mma, and what can we do for you?&#x2019; That costs seventy-five pula to say, and so it goes on. No, Rra, I will not go near those places; not me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, as he finished the last of his porridge, Mr.&nbsp;J.L.B.&nbsp;Matekoni reminded himself that the one thing he felt certain about when it came to women was that you could never be sure. If Mma Ramotswe said she had a feeling about something, then it was perfectly possible that her instinct was correct. So rather than say, &#x201c;We shall see, Mma,&#x201d; he muttered, &#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re probably right, Mma.&#x201d; And then he added, very much as an afterthought&#x2014;and a hesitant afterthought at that&#x2014;&#x201c;Who knows, Mma, what will happen? Who knows?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> When Mma Ramotswe arrived at the office that morning, Mma&nbsp;Makutsi was already there. Grace Makutsi, wife of Mr.&nbsp;Phuti Radiphuti and mother of Itumelang Clovis Radiphuti, had recently been made a full partner in the business. It had been a long road, one that stretched from her first appointment as secretary in the fledgling agency, to assistant detective, to the vague, rather unsatisfactory status of associate detective, and finally to partnership. It had been a road that started in distant Bobonong, in the north of the country, in a home that housed six people in two cramped rooms, and from there had led, through much scrimping and saving by Mma&nbsp;Makutsi&#x2019;s family, to the Botswana Secretarial College. At the end of her course the road had climbed sharply uphill to the glorious mark of ninety-seven per cent in the final examinations&#x2014;a result never before achieved at the college, and never since then equalled. But even that distinction provided in itself no guarantee of a life free of struggle, and for some years Mma&nbsp;Makutsi had been obliged to endure an existence of parsimony and want. Mma Ramotswe would have paid her more had she been able, but the No.&nbsp;1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency made no money at all, and there was a limit to how generous a loss-making business could be. There would have been no point, she thought, in giving Mma&nbsp;Makutsi a bigger salary and then having to close the business down after a month or two when it went bankrupt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma&nbsp;Makutsi understood all this. She was grateful to Mma Ramotswe for all she did for her, and so when her fortunes changed dramatically on her marriage to Mr.&nbsp;Phuti Radiphuti, she made it clear that she would not give up her job, but would continue to work at the No.&nbsp;1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency. As a partner in the business, her devotion to the enterprise became even more intense&#x2014;hence her new habit of arriving earlier than Mma Ramotswe on most mornings.<br> &nbsp;<br> To begin with, her baby son, Itumelang, accompanied his mother into the office, sleeping contentedly in his carrycot while she got on with her work. Now, however, he had become more wakeful, and consequently more demanding, and this meant that he was left at home with the woman from Bobonong who had been employed as a nursemaid.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am very happy with my life,&#x201d; said Mma&nbsp;Makutsi. &#x201c;I find professional satisfaction in my work, and at the same time I have all the pleasure of running a home. It is a very good thing when a woman can do both of these things.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, we women are doing very well in Botswana,&#x201d; agreed Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have to sit out in the lands all day. We are running businesses now. We are building roads. We are flying aeroplanes. We are doing all the things that men used to think were not for us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> For a moment, Mma&nbsp;Makutsi pictured Mma Ramotswe at the controls of a plane. It would be hard for her to keep the aircraft level, she thought, as her traditional build would make it far heavier on the side on which she was sitting. It would be possible, she felt, to adjust the controls so that the wing on her side came up a bit, but she still imagined that landings would be a bit heavy, and bumpy. Of course it would be quite a shock if one were to get into a plane and see that Mma Ramotswe was in the pilot&#x2019;s seat. It would be rude to refuse to board the plane in such circumstances, and one would simply have to put a brave face on it and hope for the best. Perhaps one could hide one&#x2019;s surprise by saying something like, &#x201c;Oh, Mma Ramotswe, I did not know that you had taken up flying. This is good news, Mma. This is a big victory for women.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Coming into the office first, Mma&nbsp;Makutsi took it upon herself to have the early morning cup of tea&#x2014;as distinct from the mid-morning and late morning cups&#x2014;ready for when Mma Ramotswe arrived. This cup was an important one, as it enabled the two women to consider their plans for the day ahead. There might have been no scientific connection between drinking tea and getting one&#x2019;s thoughts in order, but that was the way it seemed, at least in Mma Ramotswe&#x2019;s opinion. Tea brought about focus, and that helped.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;What have we today, Mma&nbsp;Makutsi?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have tea to begin with,&#x201d; said Mma&nbsp;Makutsi.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That is very good.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, we have nothing, as far as I can see, Mma.&#x201d; Mma&nbsp;Makutsi paused. &#x201c;Unless, of course, something turns up. And it might. Sometimes there is nothing at eight o&#x2019;clock and then at ten o&#x2019;clock there is something.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have a feeling there&#x2019;ll be something,&#x201d; said Mma Ramotswe. &#x201c;When I was in my garden this morning I had a feeling about that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma&nbsp;Makutsi, looking down at the surface of her desk, moved a pencil from one place to another. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said pensively. &#x201c;There might be something. Later on.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think so, Mma?&#x201d; asked Mma Ramotswe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma&nbsp;Makutsi waited some time before answering. Then at last she said, &#x201c;I am expecting some news, Mma. It might come today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mma Ramotswe knew better than to ask exactly what this news might be. Mma&nbsp;Makutsi sometime...</p><h2>The Eyes of the Overworld</h2><p>The Eyes of the Overworld is the first of Vance�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s picaresque novels about the scoundrel Cugel.

Under the cosmopolitan canopy, diverse peoples come together, and for the most part practice getting along. Anderson&#x2019;s path-breaking study of this setting provides a new understanding of the complexities of present-day race relations and reveals the unique opportunities here for cross-cultural interaction.<br><br> Anderson walks us through Center City Philadelphia, revealing and illustrating through his ethnographic fieldwork how city dwellers often interact across racial, ethnic, and social borders. People engage in a distinctive folk ethnography. Canopies operating in close proximity create a synergy that becomes a cosmopolitan zone. In the vibrant atmosphere of these public spaces, civility is the order of the day. However, incidents can arise that threaten and rend the canopy, including scenes of tension involving borders of race, class, sexual preference, and gender. But when they do&#x2015;assisted by gloss&#x2015;the resilience of the canopy most often prevails. In this space all kinds of city dwellers&#x2015;from gentrifiers to the homeless, cabdrivers to doormen&#x2015;manage to co-exist in the urban environment, gaining local knowledge as they do, which then helps reinforce and spread tolerance through contact and mutual understanding.<br><br> With compelling, meticulous descriptions of public spaces such as 30th Street Station, Reading Terminal Market, and Rittenhouse Square, and quasi-public places like the modern-day workplace, Anderson provides a rich narrative account of how blacks and whites relate and redefine the color line in everyday public life. He reveals how eating, shopping, and people-watching under the canopy can ease racial tensions, but also how the spaces in and between canopies can reinforce boundaries. Weaving colorful observations with keen social insight, Anderson shows how the canopy&#x2015;and its lessons&#x2015;contributes to the civility of our increasingly diverse cities.</p><p>Praise for The Cosmopolitan Canopy &#34;The Cosmopolitan Canopy is vintage Elijah Anderson-original, creative, engaging, and thought provoking. Once I began reading this brilliant book I could not put it down. Anderson provides an incredibly rich narrative of the interactions of city dwellers from different segregated neighborhoods-ghettos, ethnic enclaves, and suburbs-in public places. By revealing hidden social and racial dynamics, Anderson not only explains the conditions that ease racial tensions and promote interracial harmony, but those that reinforce traditional racial boundaries as well. This book is a must read.&#34;-William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor. Harvard University &#34;Elijah Anderson is a master ethnographer. Field research is a way of life for him, a medium through which unceasingly, over the course of many years, he has courageously explored the innermost recesses of life in an American city, especially the social worlds and the experiences of Black Americans. Once again, in The Cosmopolitan Canopy, he moves from one area of Philadelphia to another, exploring the patterns of social interaction and behavior in various public places. Anderson calls these urban spaces &#39;cosmopolitan canopies&#39; - a concept likely to evoke lively, illuminating discussion.&#34;-Renee C. Fox, Annenberg Professor Emerita of the Social Sciences, University of Pennsylvania &#34;This is the most important book on race relations in many years. Elijah Anderson takes us behind the statistics into the scenes of everyday life.

Forty-one years since its recording in 1959, it has sold millions worldwide and sits near the top of any list of most important records of the century. How did two impromptu sessions produce such a timeless acknowledged masterpiece?Now, for the first time, Ashley Kahn takes us into the studio to witness the creation of an album that still thrills jazz musicians, enthusiasts, and newcomers alike with its deceptively simple tunes. Using eyewitness accounts and newly discovered documents, Kahn traces Miles's move from bop to modal jazz, re-creates the sessions using master tapes (weighing in on fragmentary takes and the dispute about composers), and follows the rise of the album from its contemporary reception to its transformation into a cultural landmark through conversations with those who were there. Extensively researched and copiously illustrated, <i>Kind of Blue</i> recovers an invaluable piece of musical history and heightens fans' appreciation of the album they know and love.New and never-before-published material in <i>Kind of Blue</i> includes: The complete, unedited master session tapes, with analysis of fragmentary takes that have never been released, and studio dialogue between Davis and the musicians Over forty new interviews with musicians, producers, and critics, including Herbie Hancock, Elvin Jones, Quincy Troupe, George Avakian, Nat Hentoff-and the only people still living who witnessed the making of the album: Jimmy Cobb, engineer Bob Waller, and photographer Don Hunstein Previously unpublished photos of the recording session, featuring a rare shot of Miles's charts Studio logs and internal memos from Columbia about the making and marketing of the album The handwritten version of Bill Evans's famous liner notes</p><p>Ashley Kahn is a journalist who was the primary editor of Rolling Stone: The Seventies and the primary contributor to Rolling Stone Jazz &amp; Blues Album Guide. He has contributed articles to the New York Times, Rolling Stone, and Mojo. He lives in Jersey City, New Jersey.Da Capo has been well known as an excellent press for reissuing classic jazz books and for publishing notable foreign jazz titles, such as Francis Paudras' excellent <i>Dance of the Infidels</i> (1998), on the author's relationship with legendary jazz pianist Bud Powell, which was the springboard for Bertrand Tavernier's remarkable film, <i>'Round Midnight</i>. Recently Da Capo was acquired by the protean Perseus Group (its publishing companies include PublicAffairs, Counterpoint, and Basic Books), and Da Capo's new catalog features quite a number of promising projects. <i>Kind of Blue</i>, also the title of the groundbreaking jazz album, leads the list. In writing about the production of that classic album, Kahn necessarily writes about the making of one of the sexiest jazz musicians of all times, the epitome of cool--Miles Davis. Miles' dark, brooding good looks, Mr. Heathcliff of the improvisational world, were made to be packaged. Fortunately, Miles had a bit of talent and the sense to surround himself with musicians possessing lots of talent to accompany all his cool. To let Miles tell it, "I was playing my horn and leading the baddest band in the business, a band that was creative, imaginative, supremely tight and artistic." Incidentally, the band on <i>Blue</i> was Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans (and Wynton Kelly), Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. So Kahn breezes through this exciting discussion of the appearance and the significance of <i>Kind of Blue</i>it being the definitive introduction of modal jazz, the next step in the evolution of jazz following bebop. He's pushed along by the interpolations of quotes from musicians, record industry personnel, critics, friends, and relatives; and by vignettes, such as on the history of Columbia Records and the one about Fred Tolbert (aka Freddie the Freeloader). Kahn reports that the record <i>Kind of Blue</i> has sold millions worldwide and sells briskly, "averaging 5,000 copies a week," today. That aside, with the enthusiasm of a jazz fanatic, this is a great tribute and a fine book. <i>Bonnie Smothers</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

If you have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques; and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about.

Flameweaver Fallion, trying to unite the shattered One World, binds Borenson with Aaath Ulber, a giant horned berserker warrior. As their worlds and personalities merge, Borenson loses his human identity and family, but acquires a superhuman mission: to help Fallion bind all the worlds, uniting humans and defeating the wyrmlings forever. In this somber celebration of brutality, Farland ponders the fuzzy line between honor and obsession in a world where compassion comes with a high price. As the series grows in complexity, its appeal narrows, mostly drawing readers who like philosophy and complex machinations soaked in mud and blood. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But how can parents teach these crucial lessons in ways that are entertaining, meaningful, and respectful? What happens if they can't remember all the lessons and important historical events? This <i>Family Treasury of Jewish Holidays</i> offers some solutions to these quandaries. For instance, by reading the compelling Hebrew stories and poems aloud, parents help children learn through the realm imagination--the place where characters, images, and ancient lessons come alive. "Listening to a riveting story will build anticipation for a holiday, encourage a wish for a Jewish life, and create sweet memories of reading together," offers Malka Drucker in her introduction. The treasury also includes numerous poems, holiday crafts, recipes, and family activities.

Nick Cappuano dropped his keys into his coat pocket and stepped into the spacious, well-appointed Watergate apartment that his boss, Senator John O'Connor, had inherited from his father.<br><br>"Senator!" Nick tried to identify the foul metallic odor.<br><br>Making his way through the living room, he noticed parts and pieces of the suit John wore yesterday strewn over sofas and chairs, laying a path to the bedroom. He had called the night before to check in with Nick after a dinner meeting with Virginia's Democratic Party leadership, and said he was on his way home. Nick had reminded his thirty-six-year-old boss to set his alarm.<br><br>"Senator?" John hated when Nick called him that when they were alone, but Nick insisted the people in John's life afford him the respect of his title.<br><br>The odd stench permeating the apartment caused a tingle of anxiety to register on the back of Nick's neck. "John?"<br><br>He stepped into the bedroom and gasped. Drenched in blood, John sat up in bed, his eyes open but vacant. A knife spiked through his neck held him in place against the headboard. His hands rested in a pool of blood in his lap.<br><br>Gagging, the last thing Nick noticed before he bolted to the bathroom to vomit was that something was hanging out of John's mouth.<br><br>Once the violent retching finally stopped, Nick stood up on shaky legs, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and rested against the vanity, waiting to see if there would be more. His cell phone rang. When he didn't take the call, his pager vibrated. Nick couldn't find the wherewithal to answer, to say the words that would change everything. <em>The senator is dead. John's been murdered.</em> He wanted to go back to when he was still in his car, fuming and under the assumption that his biggest problem that day would be what to do about the man-child he worked for who had once again slept through his alarm.<br><br>Thoughts of John, dating back to their first meeting in a history class at Harvard freshman year, flashed through Nick's mind, hundreds of snippets spanning a nearly twenty-year friendship. As if to convince himself that his eyes had not deceived him, he leaned forward to glance into the bedroom, wincing at the sight of his best friend&#x2014;the brother of his heart&#x2014;stabbed through the neck and covered with blood.<br><br>Nick's eyes burned with tears, but he refused to give in to them. Not now. Later maybe, but not now. His phone rang again. This time he reached for it and saw it was Christina, his deputy chief of staff, but didn't take the call. Instead, he dialed 911.<br><br>Taking a deep breath to calm his racing heart and making a supreme effort to keep the hysteria out of his voice, he said, "I need to report a murder." He gave the address and stumbled into the living room to wait for the police, all the while trying to get his head around the image of his dead friend, a visual he already knew would haunt him forever.<br><br>Twenty long minutes later, two officers arrived, took a quick look in the bedroom and radioed for backup. Nick was certain neither of them recognized the victim.<br><br>He felt as if he was being sucked into a riptide, pulled further and further from the safety of shore, until drawing a breath became a laborious effort. He told the cops exactly what happened&#x2014;his boss failed to show up for work, he came looking for him and found him dead.<br><br>"Your boss's name?"<br><br>"United States Senator John O'Connor." Nick watched the two young officers go pale in the instant before they made a second more urgent call for backup.<br><br>"Another scandal at the Watergate," Nick heard one of them mutter.<br><br>His cell phone rang yet again. This time he reached for it.<br><br>"Yeah," he said softly.<br><br><em>"Nick!"</em> Christina cried. "Where the <em>hell</em> are you guys? Trevor's having a heart attack!" She referred to their communications director who had back-to-back interviews scheduled for the senator that morning.<br><br>"He's dead, Chris."<br><br>"Who's dead? What're you talking about?"<br><br>"John."<br><br>Her soft cry broke his heart. <em>"No."</em> That she was desperately in love with John was no secret to Nick. That she was also a consummate professional who would never act on those feelings was one of the many reasons Nick respected her.<br><br>"I'm sorry to just blurt it out like that."<br><br>"How?" she asked in a small voice.<br><br>"Stabbed in his bed."<br><br>Her ravaged moan echoed through the phone. "But who...I mean, <em>why?</em>"<br><br>"The cops are here, but I don't know anything yet. I need you to request a postponement on the vote."<br><br>"I can't," she said, adding in a whisper, "I can't think about that right now."<br><br>"You have to, Chris. That bill is his legacy. We can't let all his hard work be for nothing. Can you do it? For him?"<br><br>"Yes...okay."<br><br>"You have to pull yourself together for the staff, but don't tell them yet. Not until his parents are notified."<br><br>"Oh, God, his poor parents. You should go, Nick. It'd be better coming from you than cops they don't know."<br><br>"I don't know if I can. How do I tell people I love that their son's been murdered?"<br><br>"He'd want it to come from you."<br><br>"I suppose you're right. I'll see if the cops will let me."<br><br>"What're we going to do without him, Nick?" She posed a question he'd been grappling with himself. "I just can't imagine this world, this <em>life,</em> without him."<br><br>"I can't either," Nick said, knowing it would be a much different life without John O'Connor at the center of it.<br><br>"He's really dead?" she asked as if to convince herself it wasn't a cruel joke. "Someone killed him?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Outside the chief's office suite, Detective Sergeant Sam Holland smoothed her hands over the toffee-colored hair she corralled into a clip for work, pinched some color into cheeks that hadn't seen the light of day in weeks, and adjusted her gray suit jacket over a red scoop-neck top.<br><br>Taking a deep breath to calm her nerves and settle her chronically upset stomach, she pushed open the door and stepped inside. Chief Farnsworth's receptionist greeted her with a smile. "Go right in, Sergeant Holland. He's waiting for you."<br><br><em>Great,</em> Sam thought as she left the receptionist with a weak smile. Before she could give into the urge to turn tail and run, she erased the grimace from her face and went in.<br><br>"Sergeant." The chief, a man she'd once called Uncle Joe, stood up and came around the big desk to greet her with a firm handshake. His gray eyes skirted over her with concern and sympathy, both of which were new since "the incident." She despised being the reason for either. "You look well."<br><br>"I feel well."<br><br>"Glad to hear it." He gestured for her to have a seat.<br><br>"Coffee?"<br><br>"No, thanks."<br><br>Pouring himself a cup, he glanced over his shoulder. "I've been worried about you, Sam."<br><br>"I'm sorry for causing you worry and for disgracing the department." This was the first chance she'd had to speak directly to him since she returned from a month of administrative leave, during which she'd practiced the sentence over and over. She thought she'd delivered it with convincing sincerity.<br><br>"Sam," he sighed as he sat across from her, cradling his mug between big hands. "You've done nothing to disgrace yourself or the department. Everyone makes mistakes."<br><br>"Not everyone makes mistakes that result in a dead child, Chief."<br><br>He studied her for a long, intense moment as if he was making some sort of decision. "Senator John O'Connor was found murdered in his apartment this morning."<br><br><em>"Jesus,"</em> she gasped. "How?"<br><br>"I don't have all the details, but from what I've been told so far, it appears he was dismembered and stabbed through the neck. Apparently, his chief of staff found him."<br><br>"Nick," she said softly. "Excuse me?"<br><br>"Nick Cappuano is O'Connor's chief of staff."<br><br>"You know him?"<br><br><em>"Knew</em> him. Years ago," she added, surprised and unsettled to discover the memory of him still had power over her, that just the sound of his name rolling off her lips could make her heart race.<br><br>"I'm assigning the case to you."<br><br>Surprised at being thrust so forcefully back into the real work she had craved since her return to duty, she couldn't help but ask, "Why me?"<br><br>"Because you need this, and so do I. We both need a win."<br><br>The press had been relentless in its criticism of him, of her, of the department, but to hear him acknowledge it made her ache. Her father had come up through the ranks with Farnsworth, which was probably the number one reason why she still had a job. "Is this a test?<br><br>Find out who killed the senator and my previous sins are forgiven?"<br><br>He put down his coffee cup and leaned forward, elbows resting on knees. "The only person who needs to forgive you, Sam, is you."<br><br>Infuriated by the surge of emotion brought on by his softly spoken words, Sam cleared her throat and stood up. "Where does O'Connor live?"<br><br>"The Watergate. Two uniforms are already there. Crime scene is on its way." He handed her a slip of paper with the address. "I don't have to tell you that this needs to be handled with the utmost discretion."<br><br>He also didn't have to tell her that this was the only chance she'd get at redemption.<br><br>"Won't the Feds want in on this?"<br><br>"They might, but they don't have jurisdiction, and they know it. They'll be breathing down my neck, though, so report directly to me. I want to know everything ten minutes after you do. I'll smooth it with Stahl," he added, referring to the lieutenant she usually answered to.<br><br>Heading for the door, she said, "I won't let you down."<br><br>"You never have before."<br><br>With her hand resting on the door handle, she turned back to him. "Are you saying that as the chief of police or as my Uncle Joe?"<br><br>His face lifted into a small but sincere smile. "Both."<br><br>* * *<br><br>Sitting on John's sofa under the watchful eyes of the two policemen, Nick's mind raced with the staggering number of things that needed to be done, details to be seen to, people to call. His cell phone rang relentlessly, but he ignored it after deciding he would talk to no one until he had seen John's parents. Almost twenty years ago they took an instant shine to the hard-luck scholarship student their son brought home from Harvard for a weekend visit and made him part of their family. Nick owed them so much, not the least of which was hearing the news of their son's death from him if possible.<br><br>He ran his hand through his hair. "How much longer?"<br><br>"Detectives are on their way."<br><br>Ten minutes later, Nick heard her before he saw her. A flurry of activity and a burst of energy preceded the detectives' entrance into the apartment. He suppressed a groan. <em>Wasn't it enough that his friend and boss had been murdered? He had to face</em> her, <em>too? Weren't there thousands of District cops? Was she really the only one available?</em><br><br>Sam came into the apartment, oozing authority and competence. In light of her recent troubles, Nick couldn't believe she had any of either left. "Get some tape across that door," she ordered one of the officers. "Start a log with a timeline of who got here when. No one comes in or goes out without my okay, got it?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am. The Patrol sergeant is on his way along with Deputy Chief Conklin and Detective Captain Malone."<br><br>"Let me know when they get here." Without so much as a glance in his direction, Nick watched her stalk through the apartment and disappear into the bedroom. Following her, a handsome young detective with bed head nodded to Nick.<br><br>He heard the murmur of voices from the bedroom and saw a camera flash. They emerged fifteen minutes later, both noticeably paler. For some reason, Nick was gratified to know the detectives working the case weren't so jaded as to be unaffected by what they'd just seen.<br><br>"Start a canvass of the building," Sam ordered her partner. "Where the hell is Crime Scene?"<br><br>"Hung up at another homicide," one of the other officers replied.<br><br>She finally turned to Nick, nothing in her pale blue eyes indicating that she recognized or remembered him. But the fact that she didn't introduce herself or ask for his name told him she knew exactly who he was. "We'll need your prints."<br><br>"They're on file," he mumbled. "Congressional background check."<br><br>She wrote something in the small notebook she tugged from the back pocket of gray, form-fitting pants. There were years on her gorgeous face that hadn't been there the last time he'd had the opportunity to look closely, and he couldn't tell if her hair was as long as it used to be since it was twisted into a clip. The curvy body and endless legs hadn't changed at all.<br><br>"No forced entry," she noted. "Who has a key?"<br><br>"Who <em>doesn't</em> have a key?"<br><br>"I'll need a list. You have a key, I assume." Nick nodded. "That's how I got in."<br><br>"Was he seeing anyone?"<br><br>"No one serious, but he had no trouble attracting female companionship." Nick didn't add that John's casual approach to women and sex had been a source of tension between the two men, with Nick fearful that John's social life would one day lead to political trouble. He hadn't imagined it might also lead to murder.<br><br>"When was the last time you saw him?"<br><br>"When he left the office for a dinner meeting with the Virginia Democrats last night. Around six-thirty or so."<br><br>"Spoke to him?"<br><br>"Around ten when he said he was on his way home."<br><br>"Alone?"<br><br>"He didn't say, and I didn't ask."<br><br>"Take me through what happened this morning."<br><br>He told her about Christina trying to reach John, beginning at seven, and of coming to the apartment expecting to find the senator once again sleeping through his alarm.<br><br>"So this has happened before?"<br><br>"No, he's never been murdered before."<br><br>Her expression was anything but amused. "Do you think this is funny, Mr. Cappuano?"<br><br>"Hardly. My best friend is dead, Sergeant. A United States senator has been murdered. There's nothing funny about that."<br><br>"Which is why you need to answer the questions and save the droll humor for a more appropriate time."<br><br>Chastened, Nick said, "He slept through his alarm and ringing telephones at least once, if not twice, a month."<br><br>"Did he drink?"<br><br>"Socially, but I rarely saw him drunk."<br><br>"Prescription drugs? Sleeping pills?" Nick shook his head. "He was just a very heavy sleeper."<br><br>"And it fell to his chief of staff to wake him up? There wasn't anyone else you could send?"<br><br>"The senator valued his privacy. There've been occasions when he wasn't alone, and neither of us felt his love life should be the business of his staff."<br><br>"But he didn't care if you knew who he was sleeping with?"<br><br>"He knew he could count on my discretion." He looked up, unprepared for the punch to the gut that occurred when his eyes met hers. Her unsettled expression made him wonder if she felt it, too. "His parents need to be notified. I'd like to be the one to tell them."<br><br>Sam studied him for a long moment. "I'll arrange it. Where are they?"<br><br>"At their farm in Leesburg. It needs to be soon. We're postponing a vote we worked for months to get to. It'll be all over the news that something's up."<br><br>"What's the vote for?"<br><br>He told her about the landmark immigration bill and John's role as the co-sponsor.<br><br>With a curt nod, she walked away.</p><h2>Savior or Servant? Putting Government in Its Place</h2><p>A survey of the history of Christian political thought, including a study of scriptural bases and current discussions. This book argues for limited government based on an enduring foundation.</p><p><b>Savior or Servant? Putting Government in Its Place</b> is an attempt to define the role of the state: Shall it be a minister or a Messiah? Using ancient but timeless information, David W. Hall has surveyed the Bible and arrived at a coherent theology of the state. This study succeeds in identifying the responsibilities that the civil state is mandated to do, permitted to do, and prohibited from doing. Along the way, it is discovered that all political schemes and issues are fraught with theological value. Moreover, the most enduring grid to keep government in its rightful place is found in the Bible. Drawing upon thousands of verses and hundreds of thinkers, this volume is comprehensive yet readable. Theologians from Augustine to Calvin and from Aquinas to Barth are studied and presented in a non-technical manner. The Christian who is interested in politics should absorb these summaries before launching out into unstudied political activism. Rather than adopting a politics- as-usual posture, Hall challenges partisans from the right and from the left. He summons Christians to the old paths, which God's Word has occupied for centuries. Discussed in these chapters are perennial matters of practical importance, such as: taxation; resistance to evil governments; methods of influence; the escalation of rights; limited government; moral qualities for leaders; separation of powers. This book will provide excellent fodder for discussion and guidance. It returns spiritual principles to their place, while seeking to put government in its proper place. <p> <b>Savior or Servant?</b> Is a revival of a classic approach to limited government. In a time when nations are finally beginning to shrink bloated governments, a surprising source commends itself as an able assistant in reform. The scriptural view of the state, removed from the varied fads of political science, provides an enduring perspective by which to measure all states. This study begins with a survey of biblical teaching on pressing matters of state today. Following the contours of the Old and New Testaments, Savior or Servant? calls all levels of government to a servant posture, rather than allowing officials to dominate. A historical tracing of the best and most pertinent that theology has to offer on the subject is contained in these pages.</p>David W. Hall, Senior Fellow at the Kuyper Institute in Oak Ridge, TN, is the author or editor of 14 books on political, historical, and theological subjects.

BRYCE HAYNES,</p><p>planetary ecologist assigned to study Duneworld</p><p>When the Imperial ship arrived at Catalan&#x2019;s main spaceport, the high rank and notoriety of the passenger told Jesse Linkam that the news must be important. The Emperor&#x2019;s representative directed his transmission to the House Linkam "protocol office," demanding to be met with full honors, and without delay.</p><p>Jesse politely acknowledged, not revealing who he was or that his household had no need for a formal protocol office. He preferred not to make an issue of his rank and enjoyed spending his free time among the working class. In fact, he had spent that very afternoon fishing on Catalan&#x2019;s vast and fertile sea, making a sweep for glimmerfish before an expected storm hammered the coast. When the message arrived, he&#x2019;d been hauling in the sonic nets full of fish, laughing with the rough crewmen who struggled to get over their awe of the nobleman and accept him as one of their own.</p><p>Though he was the foremost aristocrat on Catalan, Jesse Linkam didn&#x2019;t mind getting his hands dirty. Tall and middle-aged, he was a quiet man with hidden strengths. The gray eyes measured, weighed, and counted everything. His classic features bore a rugged cast, thanks to a once-broken nose that gave his face the look of an offbeat metronome.</p><p>He was not soft and preoccupied with silly diversions like most of his noble peers on other worlds, who treated leadership like little more than a game of dress-up. Here on the "uncivilized" fringes of the Empire, too much real work needed to be done to bother with fashions and courtly intrigues. Jesse loved the fresh, salty air and considered sweaty clothes a better badge of honor than the finest whisper-lace from the Imperial capital world of Renaissance. How could anyone expect to rule a people well without knowing their daily toil, their joys and concerns?</p><p>However, because of his high station, Jesse was required by law to be at the beck and call of the Grand Emperor&#x2019;s envoy. Returning to his mansion, the Catalan nobleman changed his clothes and scrubbed the fish smell from his hands, while a doting servant spread a perfumed ointment on his chapped knuckles. As a last touch, Jesse pinned badges of office onto his own surcoat. He had no time for further grooming: Counselor Bauers would have to accept him as he was.</p><p>Out in front, he joined a hastily organized groundcar entourage already waiting to depart for the spaceport. "I hope this is important," Jesse muttered to his security chief.</p><p>"Important to you? Or to the Grand Emperor?" Esmar Tuek sat beside him in the lead vehicle as the motorcade moved with stately haste toward the landed ship. "How often does Emperor Wuda take notice of our little Catalan?" Since they were in private, Jesse allowed the old veteran to use familiar speech with him.</p><p>The question was a fair one, and Jesse hoped it would be answered soon enough. Banners fluttering, the groundcars approached the gaudy Imperial ship. The vessel&#x2019;s ramp was already extended, but no one had emerged, as if waiting for an official reception.</p><p>Jesse stepped out of the lead car. In the breeze, his dark hair whipped about like loose strands of sea kelp. He straightened his formal jacket and waited while the honor guard scrambled into position.</p><p>No doubt, the impromptu procession would only foster the impression of Catalan being a rude backwater world. On other worlds, noblemen drilled their soldiers in relentless parades and exhibitions. In stark contrast, though Jesse&#x2019;s volunteers would fight fiercely to defend their homes, they had little interest in twirling batons or marching in lockstep.</p><p>On the Imperial spacecraft&#x2019;s ramp, Counselor Ulla Bauers stepped out. His nose twitched as he sniffed the ocean-mist air, and his forehead wrinkled. The Grand Emperor&#x2019;s representative&#x2014;a prissy and ferretlike man with a demeanor of foppish incompetence&#x2014;wore a voluminous high-collared robe and dandy ornamentation that made his head seem too small.</p><p>Jesse knew not to underestimate this man, however. The Counselor&#x2019;s overemphasis on fashion and trappings might be a mere disguise; Bauers was rumored to be a swift and highly effective assassin. The fact that he had come here did not bode well.</p><p>With a flick of his fingers to one eyebrow, the traditional sign of allegiance to the Emperor, Jesse said, "Counselor Bauers, I welcome you to my humble Catalan. Won&#x2019;t you come and join us?"</p><p>The Imperial advisor descended halfway down the ramp with a smooth gait, as if his feet were on wheels. Bauers&#x2019;s piercing eyes swept the docks, the fishing boats, the weather-hardened shacks, the warehouses, and shops that ringed the harbor. He soaked up droplets of information like a dry sponge. "Hmm-ahh, yes... humble indeed, Nobleman Linkam."</p><p>The local guardsmen stiffened. Hearing an impolite grumble and a sharp, whispered rebuke from General Tuek, Jesse merely smiled. "We will gladly provide you with our most comfortable rooms, Counselor, and an invitation to this evening&#x2019;s banquet. My concubine is as skilled at managing our household kitchens as she is at organizing my business affairs."</p><p>"I have my own chef aboard this diplomatic craft." Bauers removed an ornately inlaid metal cylinder from one of his billowing sleeves and extended the messagestat like a scepter toward Jesse. "As for this evening, you would be better advised to spend your time packing. I return to Renaissance in the morning, and the Grand Emperor wishes you to accompany me. All the details are contained in this dispatch."</p><p>Feeling an icy dread, Jesse accepted the cylinder. Bowing slightly, he forced himself to say, "Thank you, Counselor. I will study it carefully."</p><p>"Be here at dawn, Nobleman." Turning with a swirl of his robes, Bauers marched back up the ramp. The dignitary had not even set foot on Catalan, as if afraid it might soil his shoes.</p><p>A COLD RAIN stretched into the darkest hours of the night, while clouds masked the canvas of stars. Standing on an open balcony above the sea, Jesse watched raindrops sizzling against the electrostatic weather screen around him. Each sparkle was like a variable star, forming transient constellations just above his head.</p><p>For most of an hour, he had been brooding. He picked up the messagestat from where it rested on the balcony rail. When he pulled on each end of the cylinder, mirrors and lenses popped up, and words spooled out in Grand Emperor Wuda&#x2019;s voice: "His Imperial Majesty requests the immediate presence of Nobleman Jesse Linkam in the Central Palace to hear our decision in the matter of the spice-production dispute over Duneworld in the Arrakis system. As the complainant, and as a duly elected representative of the Nobles&#x2019; Council, you are hereby notified that the defendant, Nobleman Hoskanner, has offered a compromise. If you refuse to appear, we shall dismiss your action, and no further arguments will be heard."</p><p>Jesse snapped the cylinder shut before the Grand Emperor&#x2019;s voice could reel off his tedious vocal signature, which included the customary list of titles and responsibilities.</p><p>Dorothy Mapes, his beloved concubine and business manager, came up behind him and touched his arm. After serving eleven years at Jesse&#x2019;s side, she knew how to interpret his moods. "Most nobles would be honored to receive a personal summons from the Grand Emperor. Shouldn&#x2019;t you give him the benefit of the doubt?"</p><p>Jesse turned to her with a quick frown. "It is couched in the best diplomatic language, but I fear this could be the end of us, my darling. Any offer from Valdemar Hoskanner comes with more than strings attached&#x2014;a noose is more likely."</p><p>"Then be cautious. Nevertheless, you know you have to deal with Valdemar. You&#x2019;ve been drawn into this dispute, and the other nobles are counting on you."</p><p>He gave her a wan, loving smile. She had short, dark hair interspersed with lighter peppery flecks. Set in an oval, attractive face, her large rusty brown eyes were the color of the polished myrtle wood found in the headlands. For a moment, he stared at the unusual diagem ring she wore on her right hand&#x2014;his nobleman&#x2019;s pledge of love to her. Though a commoner, Dorothy was not at all common.</p><p>"For years, Dor, you&#x2019;ve been my inspiration, my guiding light, and my closest advisor. You&#x2019;ve turned our family&#x2019;s finances around, repairing most of the damage my father and brother did before their deaths. But I&#x2019;m not so sure about Duneworld..." He shook his head.</p><p>The petite woman looked up at him. "See if this helps clarify your thinking." She placed a pinch of the spice melange on his lips. "From Duneworld. It&#x2019;s what this is all about."</p><p>He savored the cinnamon flavor, felt the pleasurable rush of the drug. It seemed everyone was using it these days. Shortly after the discovery of the substance on the inhospitable world, the Emperor&#x2019;s survey crews had installed forward bases and mapped the desert, laying the groundwork for exploitation of the spice. Since then, melange had become an extremely popular commodity.</p><p>In a commercial coup that left many suspecting bribery or blackmail, House Hoskanner had been granted a monopoly on Duneworld operations. Ever since, Hoskanner crews had worked the hostile dunes, harvesting and selling spice at huge profits, from which the Grand Emperor took an extravagant percentage. Imperial penal planets provided an army of sand-miners as veritable slave labor.</p><p>At first the other noble families, preoccupied with court follies, didn&#x2019;t notice the preferential deal the Hoskanners received. Jesse was one of the few who had called attention to the imbalance, and finally, eyeing the wealth reaped by the wily Hoskanners, the other nobles agitated for a piece of the action. They shouted in the Imperial Assembly, issued charges, and finally appointed the no-nonsense Jesse Linkam as their spokesman to de...</p></p><h2>Galen Beknighted (Dragonlance Heroes II : Vol.3)</h2><p>The Reluctant Knight Returns<br><br>Becoming a knight has changed the Weasel very little.

Taken from his earliest journals, this book records Muir&#39;s walk in 1867 from Indiana across Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida to the Gulf Coast. In his distinct and wonderful style, Muir shows us the wilderness, as well as the towns and people, of the South immediately after the Civil War.</p><p>In 1867, John Muir, age twenty-eight, was blinded in an industrial accident. He lay in bed for two weeks wondering if he would ever see again. When his sight miraculously returned, Muir resolved to devote all his time to the great passion of his life -- studying plants. He quit his job in an Indiana manufacturing plant, said good-bye to his family, and set out alone to walk to the Gulf of Mexico, sketching tropical plants along the way. He kept a journal of this thousand-mile walk and near the end of his life, now famous as a conservation warrior and literary celebrity, sent a typescript of it to his publisher. The result is a wonderful portrait of a young man in search of himself and a particularly vivid portrait of the post-war American South. Here is the young Muir talking with freed slaves and former Confederate soldiers, pondering the uses of electricity, exploring Mammoth Cave, sleeping in a Savannah cemetery, delirious with malarial fever in the home of strangers at Cedar Key, traveling to Havana, Cuba, and sailing to San Francisco Bay. Once in California, Muir promptly set out for Yosemite Valley -- 200 miles away. There Muir found his destiny -- and a mountain range to test his apparently inexhaustible capacity for walking. A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf bridges two Muir classics: The Story of My Boyhood and Youth and My First Summer in the Sierra.&nbsp;<b>John Muir</b> (1838-1914) was one of the most influential conservationists and nature writers in American history. He was&nbsp;instrumental in the creation and passage of the National Parks Act, and founder of&nbsp;the Sierra Club, acting as its&nbsp;president until his death.&nbsp;Muir was a spirit so free that all he did to prepare for an expedition was to "throw some tea and bread into an old sack and jump the back fence."&nbsp;</p><h2>The Anything Box</h2><p>From back cover: Don&#39;t open The Anything Box unless you&#39;re prepared for the unexpected.

Examining America's houses and cityscapes, its rural outbuildings and landscapes from perspectives including cultural geography, decorative arts, architectural history, and folklore, these articles reflect the variety and vibrancy of the growing field of vernacular architecture.</p><p>In essays that focus on buildings and spaces unique to the U.S. landscape, Clay Lancaster, Edward T. Price, John Michael Vlach, and Warren E. Roberts reconstruct the social and cultural contexts of the modern bungalow, the small-town courthouse square, the shotgun house of the South, and the log buildings of the Midwest. Surveying the buildings of America's settlement, scholars including Henry Glassie, Norman Morrison Isham, Edward A. Chappell, and Theodore H. M. Prudon trace European ethnic influences in the folk structures of Delaware and the houses of Rhode Island, in Virginia's Renish homes, and in the Dutch barn widely repeated in rural America.</p><p>Ethnic, regional, and class differences have flavored the nation's vernacular architecture. Fraser D. Neiman reveals overt changes in houses and outbuildings indicative of the growing social separation and increasingly rigid relations between seventeenth-century Virginia planters and their servants. Fred B. Kniffen and Fred W. Peterson show how, following the westward expansion of the nineteenth century, the structures of the eastern elite were repeated and often rejected by frontier builders. Moving into the twentieth century, James Borchert tracks the transformation of the alley from an urban home for Washington's blacks in the first half of the century to its new status in the gentrified neighborhoods of the last decade, while Barbara Rubin's discussion of the evolution of the commercial strip counterpoints the goals of city planners and more spontaneous forms of urban expression.</p><p>The illustrations that accompany each article present the artifacts of America's material past. Photographs of individual buildings, historic maps of the nation's agricultural expanse, and descriptions of the household furnishings of the Victorian middle class, the urban immigrant population, and the rural farmer's homestead complete the volume, rooting vernacular architecture to the American people, their lives, and their everyday creations.</p></p><p><b>Dell Upton (Editor) </b><br> DELL UPTON is an assistant professor of architectural history at the University of California at Berkeley.

Although the word "tundra" may conjure up an image of a desolate, treeless plain, the mainland portion of the Canadian Arctic is far from featurless and vibrant with life. The area is home to millions of geese and other birds, and is the haunt of some of the world&#x2019;s last, great, migratory herds of large herbivores and the predators that follow them. It is also an area where great pristine rivers cut through ranges of rugged hills strewn with boulders and serpentine, sandy eskers course over the landscape. <p>Discovering Eden explores this unspoiled, perfect, natural world, revealing a place that still exists far beyond the modern world&#x2019;s concrete jungles and polluted air. The book explores the lure of the Barren Lands and why it is , for the author, a personal Eden. The book is also filled with adventures- a personal, inner one for the author, and the thrill of canoeing this untouched wilderness for those who travel with him.</p></p><p>Alex Hall lives in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, where he operates Canoe Arctic Inc. conducting wilderness Canoeing expeditions. He is deeply concerned about the recent changes taking place in the arctic Barren Lands where Industrial development threatens vast areas of wilderness. While there is still time, aboriginal communities in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are working together with the support of World Wildlife Fund Canada to protect substantial areas of tundra in their pristine, natural state for future generations.The Big Wind In the North, there are strong summer winds; we never experience tornadoes, but small cyclones or whirlwinds are not uncommon. I've seen corridors through the bush where one of these wind funnels has flattened a swath of trees, and once when I was on a solo canoe trip a whirlwind ripped across a small lake in from of me, raising a frightening waterspout at least fifty feet high. A few years ago I got some idea of what it might be like if one of those whirlwinds actually struck you out on the water. <p>We had just made our final camp on the Thelon River. Our float planes were due to pick us up the next morning. It was thunderstorm weather: a hot, still afternoon with big dark clouds some distance away, but moving steadily in on us. Just before the wind whipped up, there was an unusual straight line in those clouds. If I ever see a line like that again, I'll recognize it for what it is - big trouble. </p><p>I don't know if the wind that slammed us that afternoon was a whirlwind or a wind shear, but whatever it was, it was by far the most violent wind I have ever experienced. It only lasted a few minutes, but it tore our camp apart. </p><p>It had been a quiet afternoon up to that point. We had over-turned but not tied down, our five canoes on a rock beach about thirty yards from the edge of the river. The beach ran along beside the river for about a quarter of a mile and ended on a sharp bend. My own canoe is twenty feet long and weighs 110 pounds. Nonetheless, the wind picked up all of those canoes like bits of paper and flew them down the full length of the rock beach, with only one or two touchdowns, before tossing them into the river. </p><p>The Thelon is fast at that point and, luckily for us, the canoes all rolled over in the river with the wind and filled up with water. We found them another half mile downstream, washed up against an outside bend on our side of the river. </p><p>It pays to have the best equipment! That tumble down the rock beach would have broken lesser canoes, but mine are constructed of Royalex, the toughest and most flexible material on today's market. Apart from a few scrapes and two broken bolts on one thwart, there was no significant damage except to my twenty-footer, which suffered a small hole. All we had to do was empty them out and portage them back into camp. It only took minutes to make a permanent repair on the twenty-footer and it was none the worse for wear.</p></p><h2>The Family Crucible</h2><p>The philosophy and methods of family therapy are revealed in an in-depth case study of a family whose daughter&#39;s deep depression resulted from her parents&#39; troubled marriage</p><p><p>This extraordinary book presents scenarios of one family&#x2019;s therapy experience and explains what underlies each encounter.

Part entrepreneur, part <em>enfant terrible,</em> Gates has become the most powerful -- and feared -- player in the computer industry, and arguably the richest man in America. In <em>Hard Drive,</em> investigative reporters Wallace and Erickson follow Gates from his days as an unkempt thirteen-year-old computer hacker to his present-day status as a ruthless billionaire CEO. More than simply a "revenge of the nerds" story though, this is a balanced analysis of a business triumph, and a stunningly driven personality. The authors have spoken to everyone who knows anything about Bill Gates and Microsoft -- from childhood friends to employees and business rivals who reveal the heights, and limits, of his wizardry. From Gates's singular accomplishments to his equally extraordinary brattiness, arrogance, and hostility (the atmosphere is so intense at Microsoft that stressed-out programmers have been known to ease the tension of their eighty-hour workweeks by exploding homemade bombs), this is a uniquely revealing glimpse of the person who has emerged as the undisputed king of a notoriously brutal industry.</blockquote></p><p><i>Hard Drive</i> charts Gates's missteps as well as his successes: the failure of OS/2 and the embarrassing delays in bringing Windows to the marketplace; the highly publicized split with IBM, which then forged an alliance with Apple to battle Microsoft; the public relations fallout over various exploits of Gates; and the investigations by the Federal Trade Commission. Wallace and Erickson also examine the combative, often abrasive side of Gates's personality that has alienated many of Microsoft's rivals and even employees, and led to his being labeled "The Silicon Bully" by <i>Business Month Magazine</i>. They report: <p> In the early 80's, Microsoft's Multiplan lost out to Lotus 1-2-3 in the marketplace. According to one Microsoft programmer, a few of the key people working on DOS 2.0 had a saying at the time that "DOS isn't done until Lotus won't run." They managed to code a few hidden bugs into DOS 2.0 that caused Lotus 1-2-3 to breakdown when it was loaded. "There were as few as three or four people who knew this was being done," the employee said. He felt the highly competitive Gates was the ringleader. </p><p> The first two female executives hired at Microsoft in 1985 were recruited to meet federal affirmative action guidelines so that the company could qualify for a lucrative Air Force contract. One source says,"They would say, 'Well, let's hire two women because we can pay them half as much as we will have to pay a man, and we can give them all this other crap work to do because they are women.' That's directly out of Bill's mouth...." Gates treated one of these executives so badly that she asked to be transferred away from him. </p><p> Microsoft managers used the company's e-mail system to secretly spy on employee work habits. Only those employees who worked weekends could collect bonuses. In time word got out and some employees logged into their e-mail on weekends with a modem from home so it would appear they had come in.</p>First unauthorized biography of Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates reveals the true story behind America's youngest billionaire. <p> At the age of 37, with a net worth of over $8 billion, Bill Gates is the richest man in America, and Microsoft Corporation, which he cofounded in 1975, is currently the most successful software company. All should be right with Bill Gates's world. Yet two allies from the early years of Microsoft's stunning success have turned against the company, pre-trial hearings have just begun in Apple's $5 billion copyright infringement lawsuit, and IBM is fiercely trying to displace Microsoft's DOS with its own OS/2. More ominous still, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating the House that Gates Built and could possibly break up Microsoft, as it did AT&amp;T. How did Microsoft get to the top and will it stay there? To what extent does the Microsoft corporate personality reflect that of its eccentric and hard-driving chairman and CEO, Bill Gates? </p><p> <i>Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire</i> is the first biography of the controversial Microsoft chairman. Despite Gate's attempt to discourage people from talking, authors James Wallace and Jim Erickson, reporters for <i>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i>, have interviewed his closest friends, associates, and former employees, as well as many of his business rivals, to provide a comprehensive portrait of this complex computer wunderkind, the company he made, and the industry he continues to shape. -- <i>From the Publisher</i><br><br>In early days when Microsoft was located in Albuquerque, after long, nighttime programming sessions, Gates would relax by speeding through the foothills in his Porsche 911. On a few late nights Gates and a friend would go to a road construction site and, after learning by trial and error to operate the complex machinery, drive them around. One night they held a bulldozer race (although neither could claim to be the winner) and another time Gates nearly backed over his Porsche. </p><p> Under intense pressure by Gates to ship the long overdue Windows software, employee dedication quickly turned to fanaticism. One of the Windows testers showed up at the office with a sleeping bag. For a month he camped in his office working around the clock and sleeping only when he couldn't stay awake. The microkids found diversion by building bombs, setting off rockets, and holding full-volume jam sessions which brought the police. One ex-Microsoft employee said, "you felt you were at the center of the universe. That was the motivation, that and just trying to get clean code out there. It was an invigorating feeling to be working for Microsoft. And all this pounding by Steve Ballmer, and yanking by Bill, was the price you paid to be there." -- <i></i></p></p><h2>Northernmost: A novel (Eide Family Series)</h2><p><b>From the acclaimed author of <i>Wintering: </i>a thrilling ode to the spirit of adventure and the vagaries of loss and love</b><br><br>In 1897, Odd Einar Eide returns home from a near-death experience in the Arctic only to discover his own funeral underway.

For example: &#34;How many eyes? How many noses? How many fingers? How many toeses?&#34;</p><p>PreSchool-K This bedtime/concept book is an unsatisfying example of both types of book. The text has been resurrected from 1949, and it shows. There is no need to expose children to such forced rhyme as, ``How many noses? /How many toeses?'' The illustrations show a contemporary young woman clad in baggy sweater and sweat pants, and the preschooler, allegedly the woman's young daughter, in various rooms of a house that reflects the era from which the text dates. It may be possible that the pair dashed back to a quaint 1940s farmhouse after their aerobics class, but they just don't appear to be at home in their surroundings. Otherwise, the Norman Rockwell-type illustrations are filled with eye-catching detail. A far better bedtime/concept book is Molly Bang's Ten, Nine, Eight (Greenwillow, 1983).

This book fills the gaps left by others. <br><br>The late Master Masatoshi Nakayama, chief instructor of the Japan Karate Association, left this book as a testament. It reveals his great experience as a karate competitor and teacher, describing and illustrating in detail all the correct movements involved in the particular block, punch, or kick you want to perfect, as well as instructions--on combining blocking techniques with decisive counterattacks. Also included is a glossary of all Japanese karate terms and a guide to their pronunciation. <br><br>Because of the lightning speed of karate techniques, normal camera work often fails to record the action accurately. For this reason, many of the photo sequences found in <em>Dynamic Karate</em> were taken using a stroboscope with a flash time of 1/10,000 of a second, enabling you to follow each movement as it is actually performed.</p><p><br>MASATOSHI NAKAYAMA carried on the tradition of his teacher, Gichin Funakoshi, the Father of Modern Karate. Long professor and director of physical education at Takushoku University, his alma mater (1937), he was chief instructor of the Japan Karate Association from 1955 until his death in 1987, A ninth degree black belt and a familiar face at tournaments, he was among the first to send instructors overseas and to encourage the development of karate as a sport along scientific lines.<br>PREFACE <p>[slightly abridged and minus the original macrons] </p><p>This book is not intended to reveal any secrets of karate, because there are no mysteries involved in the study of this martial art. The purpose of this publication is to provide a textbook for the karate student based on the techniques I have acquired during my more than thirty-year study and teaching of the art. Fundamental techniques and movements have been thoroughly analyzed, categorized, and arranged systematically to serve as a complete guide. </p><p>My teacher, Funakoshi Gichin, changed the concept of karate-jitsu (literally, "Chinese hand techniques") to karate-do (literally, "empty-hand ways") in 1935, and published the Karate-do Kyohan. This outstanding book was primarily intended as a character-building source book, but it also explains the spiritual contents of karate, classifies the various techniques, and provides an evaluation of karate as a course of physical education. Feeling the need for a modern and complete manual, I have taken the techniques mentioned in my teacher's book and have spent ten years compiling a new text of fundamental techniques based on my teaching experience at the Japan Karate Association. </p><p>Another factor which prompted me to publish this book was the growing popularity of karate as a sport. This development is, of course, welcome, but training merely to win a match can lead to the deterioration of this dynamic and powerful art. The need to build true proficiency on a solid foundation, I feel, is more important than ever. I feel that karate should be viewed from a broad standpoint. From the point of its development as a modern martial art and from the physical education aspect also, the ultimate goal of karate should be the attainment of a developed moral character built through hard and diligent training. </p><p>Systematic and scientific training is also essential. Faulty training methods can result in acquiring bad habits or even in physical injury. However, the techniques which took years to perfect in the past can be mastered in half the time with a good training manual. Hard training is necessary to obtain proficiency, but thoughtless, unsystematic training will do more harm than good. </p><p>My experience in teaching students from Western countries after the war has also provided me with many valuable hints, such as the habit of seeking answers to questions from the fields of physiology and body kinetics. In this book I have tried to explain the execution of techniques based on these principles. </p><p>I realize that karate is difficult to master without a good instructor to teach the fine points. The photographs in this book provide step-by-step instructions to each technique and should be an adequate guide to help the student learn good karate. Common faults are also shown as a guide to what should not be done.... </p><p>August, 1966 Masatoshi Nakayama</p></p><h2>The Fox in the Attic (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>A tale of enormous suspense and growing horror, <i>The Fox in the Attic</i> is the widely acclaimed first part of Richard Hughes's monumental historical fiction, "The Human Predicament." Set in the early 1920s, the book centers on Augustine, a young man from an aristocratic Welsh family who has come of age in the aftermath of World War I. Unjustly suspected of having had a hand in the murder of a young girl, Augustine takes refuge in the remote castle of Bavarian relatives. There his hopeless love for his devout cousin Mitzi blinds him to the hate that will lead to the rise of German fascism. The book reaches a climax with a brilliant description of the Munich putsch and a disturbingly intimate portrait of Adolph Hitler.<br><br><i>The Fox in the Attic</i>, like its no less remarkable sequel <i>The Wooden Shepherdess</i>, offers a richly detailed, Tolstoyan overview of the modern world in upheaval. At once a novel of ideas and an exploration of the dark spaces of the heart, it is a book in which the past returns in all its original uncertainty and strangeness.</p><p>Richard Hughes (1900-1976) was born in Surrey, England, but his ancestors came from Wales and he considered himself a Welshman. After an early childhood marked by the deaths of two older siblings and his father (his mother then went to work as a magazine journalist), Hughes attended boarding school and, with every expectation of being sent to fight in the First World War, enrolled in the military. Armistice was declared, however, before he could see active service, and Hughes was free to go to Oxford, where he became a star on the university literary scene, with a book of poems in print and a play produced in the West End by the time he graduated in 1922. Hughes&#x2019;s first novel,&nbsp;<i>A High Wind in Jamaica</i>, came out in 1928 and was a best seller in the United Kingdom and America.&nbsp;<i>In Hazard</i>&nbsp;followed ten years later. Hughes also wrote stories for children and radio plays, but his final major undertaking was the &#x201c;The Human Predicament&#x201d;, an ambitious amalgamation of fact and fiction that would track the German and English branches of a single family into the disaster of the Second World War while offering a dramatic depiction of Hitler&#x2019;s rise to power. The work was planned as a trilogy, but remained incomplete at the time of Hughes&#x2019;s death. The first volume,&nbsp;<i>The Fox in the Attic</i>, appeared in 1960, to great critical acclaim; volume two,&nbsp;<i>The Wooden Shepherdess</i>, was published in 1973. All of Hughes&#x2019;s completed novels are available fromNYRB&nbsp;Classics.<br><br>Hilary Mantel is the author of many novels, including&nbsp;<i>Beyond Black</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Wolf Hall.</i>[A] magnificent, authoritative, compassionate, ironic, funny, and tragic book, in which emotional and intellectual developments in private persons are seen to be now parallel to, now conditioned by, economic and political actions.<br>&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>The Times Literary Supplement<br></i><br>An impressive and unusual historical novel.<br>&#x2014; Michael Holroyd<br><br>Hughes does not write with a researcher&#x2019;s smug wisdom-after-the-event but with an artist&#x2019;s power of recording the past as if it were the living present...The long passages on the Munich beer-hall putsch of 1923, Hitler&#x2019;s escape, hiding and capture are a tour de force of dreamlike action.<br>&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Time<br></i><br>[<i>The Fox in the Attic</i>] has many virtues, many strong and compelling moments; it continues Hughes&#x2019;s particular method of tracing the misapprehensions, confusions, and wrong-headedness of people who are either not able to grasp the complex currents of the world they live in, or are blinded by the obsessions of child mentality or political fanaticism or religion.<br>&#x2014; John Crowley,&nbsp;<i>The Boston Review</i></p><h2>Shelby and AC Cobra</h2><p><p>In the new edition of this classic text, Brian Laban brings the story of the AC Cobra up to date. In the early 1960s, a flamboyant Texan, Carroll Shelby, dreamed of a special kind of sports car, a marriage of European style with lusty, affordable American V8 power. He took his dream forward and he persuaded British sports car specialist AC Cars to build his car, and US industry giant the Ford Motor Co to fund it. Its name also came to him in a dream - Cobra. The original production of the Cobra lasted just five years and encompassed barely a thousand cars built within the original framework. But it was only the beginning of a story that is still very much alive, encompassing 'continuations', spin-offs, and a massive worldwide replica industry.<i> Shelby and AC Cobra</i> details the man behind the cars, the story of their development and engineering, racing pedigree and owning and driving these powerful, iconic cars today.</p></p><p><p><b>Brian Laban</b> has been writing about cars, the motor industry and motor sport for more than forty years, for magazines, newspapers, broadcast and online content.

Their &#x201c;fight for the people&#x201d; rhetoric may sound good at first, but history proves egalitarian governments and the cultures they try to create destroy freedom, destroy creativity, destroy human lives, create poverty and misery, and often spread beyond their borders to bring others under slavery. Utopians believe that through their own personal brilliance a better society can be created on earth. When the belief in man as a creation in the image of God is completely rejected, the use of slavery and mass execution can be justified in the name of the creation of a utopian state for the masses. Pol Pot, Vladimir Lenin, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Mao Tse-tung&#x2015;together these so-called visionaries through their fanciful policies are responsible for the deaths of millions of people.</p><p>In <i>Utopian Road to Hell</i> William J. Murray, son of atheist apologist Madelyn Murray O&#x2019;Hair, describes the totalitarians throughout history and the current utopians who are determined to engage in social engineering to control the lives of every person on earth. From Marx to Hitler, Murray explains the progression of socialist engineering from its occultist roots to the extreme madness of the Nazis&#x2019; nationalistic racism. From Margaret Sanger&#x2019;s Planned Parenthood and Saul Alinsky&#x2019;s <i>Rules for Radicals</i>, the rebellious desire to be free from morality drives the &#x201c;at-any-cost&#x201d; campaigns such as abortion on demand, no-fault divorce, same-sex marriage, and overreaching government provisions. From Woodrow Wilson&#x2019;s &#x201c;living document&#x201d; distortion of the Constitution and his income tax to FDR&#x2019;s New Deal to Obama&#x2019;s executive orders, those who seek centralized power typically do so by proclaiming some utopian scheme that they claim will perfect mankind and eliminate competition, greed, poverty, and war.</p><p>William J. Murray masterfully educates us on the utopians&#x2019; swath of destruction throughout history and warns us of the dangers of present-day utopians fighting to hold power. We must heed the warning of George Washington when he said in his 1796 <i>Farewell Address</i> that it is important for those entrusted with the administration of this great and free nation, &#x201c;to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another.&#x201d; We must reclaim the freedom of the individual to avoid the continued path down the utopian road to hell.</p></p><p><b>William J. Murray</b> is the chairman of the Religious Freedom Coalition in Washington, DC. For more than two decades he has been at the forefront of social conservatism. He continues to work for the rights of Christians in America and persecuted Christians around the world and is the author of seven books.Utopian dreamers are both deceived and deceitful. Their &#x201c;fight for the people&#x201d; rhetoric may sound good at first, but history proves egalitarian governments destroy freedom, destroy creativity, and destroy human lives. Although utopians believe that through their own personal brilliance a better society can be created on earth, they inevitably create poverty and misery. Moreover by rejecting God and the sacredness of human life, they end up justifying great evils like slavery and mass execution, all in the name of the utopian state. In Utopian Road to Hell William J. Murray, son of former atheist apologist Madelyn Murray O&#x2019;Hair, masterfully exposes the wide swath of destruction such deluded leaders have created throughout history and warns of the dangers posed by today's power-obsessed utopians. He reveals that Marx and Hitler&#x2019;s socialist engineering had occult roots, leading to the extreme madness of the Nazis&#x2019; nationalistic racism; The murderous regimes of so-called utopian visionaries Pol Pot, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong were responsible for the death of tens of millions of people; Margaret Sanger (Planned Parenthood founder) and Saul Alinsky&#x2019;s rebellious desire to be free from morality has led to a crumbling society; and Woodrow Wilson&#x2019;s &#x201c;living document&#x201d; Constitution, FDR&#x2019;s New Deal, and Obama&#x2019;s Affordable Healthcare Act have centralized power by proclaiming a utopian salvation for the masses.To avoid continuing down the path of the utopian road to hell, Murray explores with readers the absolute necessity of reclaiming the freedoms of each individual and what that truly entails.</p><h2>Those Across the River</h2><p>Failed academic Frank Nichols and his wife, Eudora, have arrived in the sleepy Georgia town of Whitbrow, where Frank hopes to write a history of his family's old estate-the Savoyard Plantation- and the horrors that occurred there.

She sold the caf� in 1990 to raise her family and devote more time to creating new recipes.</p>In her second vegetarian cookbook, former Vermont restaurateur Callan (The Horn of the Moon Cookbook, 1987) shows home cooks how to incorporate vegetarian dishes into their family meals. Callan uses ingredients such as tahini, tofu, tamari, seitan and arrowroot flour, but less adventurous cooks can still find plenty of choices among the 250 recipes for breakfast, lunch and dinner items. Some 100 healthful recipes are specifically marked for beginners and for young children to prepare with adult supervision.

Recipes call for standard versions of cream, cheese and sour cream.

It has touched more than one generation, as over the years, many parents have shared the magic of this wonderful movie with their children. Seven very special people experienced The Sound Of Music firsthand-the seven young actors cast as the von Trapp children. Now, to celebrate 50 years since the film&#39;s release, they tell their stories about making this film, from their auditions to rehearsals in Los Angeles to an incredible spring and summer in Salzburg, Austria. What was it like to work with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer? How did they learn the songs and dances for the musical numbers? Who almost drowned when the boat tipped over? What was it like to attend the gala Hollywood premiere? What were their lives like after starring in this legendary movie? And how did they become a family in real life, remaining as close as any brothers and sisters for the last 50 years? The answers are revealed at last, along with personal cherished memorabilia, such as letters sent home to their families from Europe, a page from the script with edits written in the margin, and a ticket to the premiere. For anyone who is thrilled by the sight of Julie Andrews spinning around on top of a mountain, or who spontaneously bursts out singing &#34;Do-Re-Mi,&#34; this captivating behind-the-scenes story is a must read.</p><p></p><h2>Castle: Medieval Days and Knights (A Sabuda &amp; Reinhart Pop-up Book)</h2><p>National bestselling pop-up artists and engineers Robert Sabuda and Matthew Reinhart present a new stunning pop-up book all about castles.<br><br>Over fifteen intricate pop-ups accompany Sabuda and Reinhart's fascinating text, which guides readers through the different aspects of life in a medieval castle. Readers will learn about knighting ceremonies, battles, and feasts. The true majesty of castles is fully realized when this book is opened to reveal a stunning 3-dimensional medieval world.</p><p>Grade 2-5&#x2013;Chatty text and cleanly designed pop-up illustrations provide a hasty overview of life during the Middle Ages. Spreads briefly cover the construction and exterior footprint of a fortress; rooms (from the chapel above to the dungeon below); jobs performed by craftsmen and inhabitants; knighthood, armor, and weapons; a tournament; and a feast. Information is presented in a smoothly flowing narrative that tends toward the enthusiastic (Without an impressive and impregnable castle, you'd be in danger of losing your crown, your title, your lands...even your head!). There is no glossary, but terms such as parapets, oubliette, and trebuchet are defined in context. Featuring scenes such as a multifloored castle interior, a shiny suit of armor, and a joust (with a pull-tab that moves horses toward one another), the pop-ups are colorful and sturdily constructed. Eye-catching details abound in the cartoon-style illustrations; two men nap after a meal on the fortress roof, an extremely unhappy gong farmer cleans the garderobe pit, and a serving woman receives an unwanted pinch during a feast. Libraries having the dough for solteties (sugar-sculpted desserts served by the wealthy) should consider purchasing this fun-to-browse book, while those starved for funds should stick with meatier fare.<i>&#x2013;Joy Fleishhacker,</i>School Library Journal <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.This striking pop-up book published under the imprimatur of paper engineers Robert Sabuda and Matthew Reinhart, introduces a medieval European castle and the activities within it. Open the first double-page spread and up pops a three-dimensional castle, including its walls, courtyard, and drawbridge, with two smaller gatefold pages revealing other pop-up scenes. From the alchemist in the tower to the prisoners in the torture chamber, the vision of medieval times seems romanticized and the text secondary to the pleasing artwork and paper engineering. Still, Olmon provides plenty of interesting facts about the castle, its inhabitants, and their activities, and what other book includes a working, pop-up catapult that can shoot a spitball three feet?

He was a physician, but he was also a Christian priest whose life and freedom were in constant danger in a city of people who believed in so many gods, not just one. So Valentine tended to his patients in the daytime, but he prayed for them only at night.<p>One day a jailer from the emperor's prison appeared at Valentine's door with his small child, a girl who was blind. Knowing the difficulty of curing blindness, Valentine vowed to do his best, and over the weeks of treatment and prayer the three became fast friends. But even his friendship with the jailer could not save Valentine when the Roman soldier came to imprison him.</p><p>Here, accompanied by Robert Shabuda's dramatic mosaics evoking the time period in which the story takes place, is the story of a man whose goodness and faith brought about a miracle, and whose name lives on today in one of our most celebrated holidays.</p></p><p>ROBERT SHABUDA grew up in Pickney, Michigan, and is a graduate of Pratt Institute in New York City. He has illustrated several books for children, among which are <i>Walden</i> by Henry david Thoreau; and <i>I Hear America Singing</i> by Walt Whitman. <i>Earth Verses and Water Rhymes</i> by J. Patrick Lewis (1991) was Mr. Sabuda's first book with Atheneum. He currently lives in New York City with his companion, Dale Stine, and their cats, Tammy and Reba.Stunning mosaics crafted from marbleized and hand-painted paper depict this legend of Valentine, a humble Roman physician and "priest of the Christians" whose patients include a jailer's blind daughter. Recognizing the danger of praying to a single god (rather than to the numerous gods most Romans worship), Valentine prays for his patients only at night, but he is eventually imprisoned. Aware of his fate, he writes to the jailer's daughter, who receives her sight when a crocus drops into her hand from the scroll her father reads is "from your Valentine." The book's matter-of-fact narrative (some explanations are simplified for the intended audience) rightly points the reader's attention to Sabuda's intricately conceived mosaics. The marbleized paper creates subtle textures and shading, while vertical illustrations exude drama and compassion. Sabuda extends his mosaic motif onto the white space by constantly expanding and fragmenting it with full-page illustrations; tall, rectangular frames; patterned border strips and blocks of type. The resulting interplay of geometric shapes and color lends an especially appropriate classical appearance to this singular work.

This is the story of a fateful year that prefigured the events of 1776.<br><br>In <i>The Fever of 1721</i>, Stephen Coss brings to life an amazing cast of characters in a year that changed the course of medical history, American journalism, and colonial revolution, including Cotton Mather, the great Puritan preacher, son of the president of Harvard College; Zabdiel Boylston, a doctor whose name is on one of Boston&#x2019;s grand avenues; James and his younger brother Benjamin Franklin; and Elisha Cooke and his prot�g� Samuel Adams.<br> <br>During the worst smallpox epidemic in Boston history Mather convinced Doctor Boylston to try a procedure that he believed would prevent death&#x2014;by making an incision in the arm of a healthy person and implanting it with smallpox. &#x201c;Inoculation&#x201d; led to vaccination, one of the most profound medical discoveries in history. Public outrage forced Boylston into hiding, and Mather&#x2019;s house was firebombed.<br> <br>A political fever also raged. Elisha Cooke was challenging the Crown for control of the colony and finally forced Royal Governor Samuel Shute to flee Massachusetts. Samuel Adams and the Patriots would build on this to resist the British in the run-up to the American Revolution. And a bold young printer James Franklin (who was on the wrong side of the controversy on inoculation), launched America&#x2019;s first independent newspaper and landed in jail. His teenage brother and apprentice, Benjamin Franklin, however, learned his trade in James&#x2019;s shop and became a father of the Independence movement.<br> <br>One by one, the atmosphere in Boston in 1721 simmered and ultimately boiled over, leading to the full drama of the American Revolution.</p><p><i>The Fever of 1721</i> is Stephen Coss&#x2019;s first book. He lives in Madison, Wisconsin.The Fever of 1721 1<p></p> IDOL OF THE MOB<p></p> <br>For a few hours on a sunny, crisp morning in October 1716, royal governor Samuel Shute&#x2019;s administration looked quite promising, at least from the outside. Salutes fired from the cannon of the town&#x2019;s batteries and the guns of two British warships in the harbor alerted Boston of Shute&#x2019;s imminent arrival and brought thousands of people to the waterfront for a glimpse of the first new governor in fourteen years. By the time the Lusitania docked at the end of Long Wharf a line of spectators extended the full third-of-a-mile length of the wharf and another quarter mile up King Street to the Boston Town House, where the formal welcome and swearing in would be conducted.<br> <br>The man who appeared on deck, waving to his new constituents and acknowledging their cheers, had small, wide-set eyes, a puggish nose, full cheeks, and a capacious double chin that billowed like a sail over the top of his neck cloth. He was plumper and older than the war hero people had heard about, the man who had fought valiantly under Marlborough and been wounded on the battlefield in Flanders. Aside from his military credentials, all average Bostonians knew about the fifty-four-year-old retired colonel was that he had been raised a Puritan. Shute had converted to the Church of England, presumably in the interest of career advancement. But the knowledge that he shared the religious heritage of a majority of Bostonians was a comfort to those who remembered the hostility of an earlier, Puritan-hating Anglican governor who had commandeered their meetinghouses for Church of England services and had made an ostentatious show of his celebration of Christmas, a holiday Puritans not only refused to recognize but considered sacrilegious. More than anything, though, what excited the people of Boston about Samuel Shute was that he was not Joseph Dudley, his predecessor. With a new chief executive came new hope for solutions to the colony&#x2019;s challenges, better cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of the colonial government, and more equitable relations with the mother country.<br> <br>But many political insiders were skeptical that Samuel Shute constituted a new start, a change from the status quo. Although they, too, knew little about the man, they had discovered that his appointment had been finagled by friends of Joseph Dudley, who had first bribed the man originally appointed to replace Dudley into relinquishing the position. The mere possibility that Shute was in the pocket of Dudley and his son Paul, the colony&#x2019;s attorney general, was enough to earn him enemies among his new constituents. Many persons had never forgiven Dudley for his betrayal of Massachusetts nearly three decades earlier, when he had served as henchman to the most despotic governor in the colony&#x2019;s history, Edmund Andros. In 1689, the people had risen up and deposed Andros, jailing and eventually deporting him to England along with Dudley and another man, Edward Randolph. Thirteen years later the Crown had sent Dudley back to Massachusetts as its governor. Fears that he would revenge himself on his jailers with draconian assaults on individuals and group liberties had proven largely unfounded. But his administration had been both arbitrary enough and corrupt enough to spur two unsuccessful attempts to have him recalled. Having survived those, he might have remained governor for the rest of his life had Queen Anne not died prematurely at age forty-nine and her successor, George Louis, not decided to do as most new monarchs did and replace his predecessor&#x2019;s appointments with men who would be in his debt. On his way out of office, Dudley had given his political opponents two final reasons to despise him, tacitly approving the scheme to rig the selection of his replacement, and double-crossing supporters of a plan to alleviate the worsening silver currency shortage by creating a private bank that would emit paper currency. After making those men believe that he would endorse the venture, he had worked secretly behind the scenes to assure its defeat.<br> <br>The bank&#x2019;s supporters were still smarting from that act of duplicity as the carriage carrying the man Dudley&#x2019;s friends had picked to replace him made its way up King Street. In the months prior to Shute&#x2019;s departure for America, Dudley&#x2019;s men had thoroughly indoctrinated him in their anti-private-bank philosophy, preparing him to fend off any new attempts to launch the bank or force the government to emit paper currency. But the currency controversy was about to change in ways the new governor was unprepared to handle, evolving from a dry and somewhat tedious argument over monetary policy into a far-reaching debate over class entitlement, freedom of dissent, Americans&#x2019; liberties as Englishmen, and the colony&#x2019;s right to self-determination, and becoming, as one historian put it, &#x201c;the secret of political alignment&#x201d; for a generation of emerging patriots and loyalists.1<br> <br>SHUTE MADE TWO stops along the parade route up King Street. The first was to greet a group of the town&#x2019;s ministers. The second was to meet with Joseph Dudley. That meeting took place in view of a &#x201c;great Concourse of People&#x201d; and a sizable group of dignitaries who had gathered at the foot of the Town House for Shute&#x2019;s public welcoming ceremony.2 Those dignitaries included members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives (who were known as deputies); their colleagues in the upper house, the Governor&#x2019;s Council (who were known as councilors or assistants); the president of Harvard College; and numerous judges and other prominent gentlemen of the province. No one among that group was more put off by the conspicuous show of affection between the old governor and the new than the Boston representative Elisha Cooke, who had been elected to the Massachusetts House for the first time the previous year at the relatively young age of thirty-eight. Cooke came from Massachusetts political royalty: He was the grandson of John Leverett, an early governor of Massachusetts, and the son of Elisha Cooke Sr., the colony&#x2019;s most influential anti-Crown politician. Cooke Sr. had been the most outspoken critic of England&#x2019;s 1684 revocation of the founding Massachusetts charter, the act that had taken the power to choose its own governor away from the colony and given it to England, and one of the leaders of the 1689 uprising against Andros, the tyrant England had installed as royal governor shortly after the charter&#x2019;s cancellation. He had been nearly as critical of the &#x201c;New Charter&#x201d; of 1691, which had restored some liberties but left with England both the power to appoint the governor and to disallow objectionable laws. Thereafter, he and members of his &#x201c;Old Charter Party&#x201d; had categorically opposed &#x201c;royal authority over the colony and the governors&#x2019; attempts to rule by prerogative.&#x201d;3 Outraged by the traitorous Joseph Dudley&#x2019;s appointment as royal governor, Cooke Sr. had become his &#x201c;pointed enemy.&#x201d;4 The historian John Eliot wrote that Cooke Sr. &#x201c;never missed the opportunity of speaking against his [Dudley&#x2019;s] measures, or declaring his disapprobation of the man.&#x201d;5 Right up until his death in 1715 he had also criticized Dudley&#x2019;s &#x201c;Prerogative Party&#x201d; supporters, men who, he charged, kowtowed to the royal governor and the Crown in order to pad their fortunes or, in the case of some of the once-prominent families from the colony&#x2019;s founding era, to prop up their diminishing status.<br> <br>Elisha Cooke Sr. and his only son were so closely aligned politically that one detractor would describe Cooke Jr.&#x2019;s contempt for English authority as a disease he had &#x201c;caught&#x201d; from his father.6 Indeed, he had followed his father&#x2019;s example in nearly every respect. Both father and son had attended Harvard College, trained as physicians, and left the regular practice of medicine for success as businessmen. The younger Cooke&#x2019;s ventures included a salt plant on Boston neck, a stake in Long Wharf (to that point the largest infrastructure project in America), and investments in Boston warehouses and taverns and in thousands of acres of prime Maine timberland. His real passion and talent, though, were for politics. Outmaneuvered by Joseph Dudley in his first foray into political dealings at the provincial level&#x2014;the attempt to launch a private bank&#x2014;he had nevertheless proven himself a formidable opponent. Dudley&#x2019;s biographer wrote that the cagey old governor, who had survived two recalls, understood that Cooke Jr. and his bank partners represented &#x201c;a faction more dangerous than any other combination he had faced.&#x201d;7<br> <br>With wealth, education, social standing, and a talent for public speaking&#x2014;his oratory was described as &#x201c;animating, energetic, concise, persuasive, and pure&#x201d;&#x2014;Cooke had the credentials and skills necessary to succeed as a conventional eighteenth-century politician.8 It surprised no one that within months of his election to the House he had already achieved a leadership position. But other, more unconventional talents and tactics would help him rise above conventional politicians and become the most significant and powerful Boston politician in the decades preceding the American Revolution&#x2014;more hated by England than anyone but Samuel Adams (in whose political education Cooke would pay a formative role).<br> <br>Shortly after their defeat of the private bank, Dudley&#x2019;s Prerogative Party men had attempted to change the form of Boston&#x2019;s government from the town meeting to an English-style incorporated borough system. Boston was and always had been the locus of political resistance and general incorrigibility. The town meeting, Dudley knew, fed that rebelliousness, since it gave all the people, even those without the vote, the power to speak their minds, required votes on all major issues, and mandated the yearly election of selectmen who managed town affairs. By instituting an incorporated system whereby representation came from aldermen appointed for life and vested with the power to choose a mayor, controlling the town became as simple as either arranging for the &#x201c;right&#x201d; men to be chosen alders or using favors and bribes to influence them. Recognizing what Dudley and his friends were up to, Cooke had published two anonymous pamphlets that declared incorporation &#x201c;an oligarchic plot&#x201d; by political and economic elites bent on rigging the government, the currency system, and the entire economy for their benefit.9 The pamphlets reminded rank-and-file Bostonians that each freeholder had the &#x201c;undoubted right&#x201d; to &#x201c;speak his Opinion, and give his Advice, and Vote, too, concerning any Affair to be transacted by the Town,&#x201d; and that to turn over that power to an alderman was to squander this &#x201c;great Privilege their Ancestors have conveyed to them.&#x201d;10 In asserting that the people were &#x201c;Free-born and in bondage to no Man,&#x201d; in claiming inviolable political liberties, and in rejecting the assumption that the wealthy, the powerful, the highborn, and, by extension, the royal, were superior to the average man, Cooke&#x2019;s pamphlets articulated, perhaps for the first time, a distinctly and defiantly American political identity.11<br> <br>The success of those pamphlets&#x2014;the incorporation plan was dropped before the next opportunity to vote on it&#x2014;gave credence to Cooke&#x2019;s instinct for a new kind of politics. No one, not even Cooke&#x2019;s father, had thought to cultivate popular support or opposition to leverage a political agenda. Most conventional politicians wouldn&#x2019;t have known how to do it if they had wanted to. Cooke, though, had begun to master the art of speaking the language of the people. His classrooms were the taverns of Boston, where, by lending an ear and buying a round, he earned a reputation as not only &#x201c;a drinking man without equal&#x201d; but also a political leader &#x201c;generous to needy people of all classes.&#x201d;12 After a few rums the social and economic differences between the hardscrabble tradesmen and the wealthy Harvard man melted away, and the former saw the latter as one of their own. It helped that he looked the part. With a broad, fleshy face, full lips, jutting knob of a chin, and slight broadening at the bridge of his nose, he looked more like a workingman than an aristocrat, and more like a brawler than a fast-talking dandy. As he set about evolving his father&#x2019;s Old Charter Party into what would come to be known as the Popular Party, he took every opportunity to exploit his workingman image. Eventually he would sit for his only known portrait wearing a brown periwig, the color of a tradesman. A future royal governor would sneer at his willingness to court the favor of the middling and the poor, mocking him as &#x201c;the idol of the Mob.&#x201d;13 But it was the support of the &#x201c;mob&#x201d; that would make Cooke the Crown&#x2019;s most formidable threat.<br> <br>HAVING REACHED THE Town House, Samuel Shute was welcomed with a brief proclamation thanking God for his safe arrival. That sentiment was punctuated by musketfire from two companies of militia. When the smoke cleared, the governor was escorted into the Town House and up the stairs to the Council chamber, where his commission was read along with that of the new lieutenant governor&#x2014;Joseph Dudley&#x2019;s son-in-law, William Dummer. Then both men laid their hands on the Bible and, in the words of one observer, &#x201c;kiss&#x2019;d it very industriously,&#x201d; completing the ceremony.14 At one o&#x2019;clock Shute was feted at a large, formal dinner whose guest list included his Council and &#x201c;many&#x201d; members of the Massachusetts House.15 After toasts had been drunk and the meal consumed, the speaker of the House turned to Shute, explained that the governor&#x2019;s official residence, the Province House, was not yet ready for him, and offered him lodging in the home of William Tailer, the man who had served as interim governor between the end of Dudley&#x2019;s commission and Shute&#x2019;s arrival. The offer was important symbolically, since Dudley and the pro-bank Tailer had argued acrimoniously over who should occupy the governorship until Shute arrived, with each man accusing the other of trying to steal control of the colony. Tailer&#x2019;s welcoming gesture reassured the people that a smooth, orderly transition of power was under way. Similarly, acceptance of the offer would send the message that although Shute was friendly with Dudley, he planned to work with both of the colony&#x2019;s political factions. But much to the surprise of nearly everyone in attendance, Shute declined the offer, announcing that he had already accepted an invitation to stay with Paul Dudley, whose devotion to England&#x2019;s prerogative rule of the colony eclipsed his father&#x2019;s and who years earlier had infamously asserted that Massachusetts would &#x201c;never be worth living in for Lawyers and Gentlemen, till the Charter is taken away.&#x201d;16 In his diary that evening the conservative judge and councilor Samuel Sewall would write: &#x201c;The Governour&#x2019;s going to Mr. Dudley&#x2019;s makes many fear that he is deliver&#x2019;d up to a Party. Deus avertat Omen!&#x201d; [God forbid!].17 Maybe the only man neither in on the plan nor shocked by it was Elisha Cooke, who expected no better from any man who had won endorsement by both the Crown and the Dudleys. While others had hoped that Shute&#x2019;s arrival would bring a fresh start, Cooke had simply wanted an excuse to attack. And now, on his first day as governor, Shute had given him one.<br> <br>ALTHOUGH ENGLAND HAD the power to appoint any governor it saw fit, a loophole in the 1691 charter had left th...</p><h2>The Georgics (Penguin Classics) (English and Latin Edition)</h2><p>Virgil&#39;s classic poem extols the virtues of work, describes the care of crops, trees, animals, and bees, and stresses the importance of moral values</p><p>Virgil&#39;s Georgics, by common consent one of the great poems of Western literature, purports to be a didactic poem on agriculture, but its true subject is man and his place in nature and society. It is also a landmark in the use of the natural world as material for literature, and in the history of man&#39;s attitude to his environment. The poem is of special interest because Virgil brings to bear his own sympathetic understanding as well as his wide reading in Greek and Latin literature. This definitive commentary by the late Sir Roger Mynors presents the poet&#39;s meaning in such away as to bring about a fuller understanding and enjoyment of the poetry, and should be an invaluable companion for all serious students of Latin literature.Virgil, born in 70 B.C., is best remembered for his masterpiece, <i>The Aeneid</i>. He earned great favor by portraying Augustus as a descendant of the half-god, half-man Aeneas. Although Virgil swore on his deathbed that <i>The Aeneid</i> was incomplete and unworthy, it has been considered one of the greatest works of Western literature for more than two thousand years. <br><b>Betty Radice</b> read classics at Oxford, then married and, in the intervals of bringing up a family, tutored in classics, philosophy and English.

Born on the side of the road to a dying teenager, John Bevan grew into happiness and safety on an idyllic Shenandoah Valley orchard, falling in love as a teenager, eventually marrying his high school sweetheart and having a daughter with her. When, pregnant with their second child, his wife dies in a car accident, John finds his faith and ability to function shattered. Attending the site of her death, John encounters the Cross Gardener, a man who tends the roadside memorials of strangers, and with his help John finds himself returning to the path of responsibility and righteousness. This title offers the same kind of values-focused emotionalism that fans expect, with plenty of uplift and tradition-affirming sentiment; even by the standard of his other work, however, this effort is prudish and clunky, and John often comes across as more sullen than bereaved. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For the extraordinary writer James Salter, this moment was contained in the fighter planes over Korea where, during his young manhood, he flew more than one hundred missions. As The New York Times noted, "It isn&#x2019;t often that a writer of superlative skills knows enough about flying to write well about it; Saint-Exupery was one; Salter is another."<br><br>The editors have gathered selections from a journal Salter kept during the Korean War, published here for the first time, and assembled selections from two novels, The Hunters and Cassada, and from the author&#x2019;s celebrated memoir, Burning the Days. As the editors comment in a brief introduction, "It is, as a record of the day-to-day, mission-to-mission life of a young fighter pilot, a remarkable document by any standard. But it provides as well a view into the crucible of a writer&#x2019;s beginnings, like pencil studies that precede a painting, in which the essential qualities of the artist&#x2019;s hand are unmistakable.&#x2019; "<br></p><p>James Salter is considered one of America&#39;s greatest prose stylists. A former Air Force pilot who flew F-86 fighters in Korea, Salter writes with matchless insight about the terror and exhilaration of the pilot&#39;s life.A splendid thing in a small package is this flying book compiled from several earlier works of fiction (including the great novel of Korean War aviation, <i>The Hunters</i>) and memoir, and from Salter's journals. Salter graduated from West Point in 1945 and went straight into the Army Air Force, later the U.S. Air Force. His training was not always smooth&#x2014;he once lost his way over Pennsylvania and crashed into a house in Massachusetts. But he survived to qualify in fighters and to fly a tour of duty (100 missions) in Korea in F-86s, shooting down one MiG. After the war Salter flew fighters in Europe before resigning from the air force to embark upon a distinguished literary career. The text has excerpts from <i>The Hunters</i>; another novel about the European years, <i>Cassada</i>; his previous memoir <i>Burning the Days</i>; and an unpublished diary from the Korean tour. Although it's sometimes difficult to tell whose voice one is hearing, all the voices have a superb command of the English language and vividly depict the sensations and human interactions involved in flying. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Take his description of the near-vertical (and now well-skied) slope that nearly killed Max Engelhart in 1926: "Tuckerman Ravine is a sort of twin to Huntington Ravine, a left-hand punch into the side of Mount Washington by the same primordial giant that made Huntington with his right." Underlying <i>Not Without Peril</i> is the not-so-subtle message that the Presidential Range, topping out at just over 6,000 feet, is as uncompromising as any other mountain range. After all, these mountains--named for Washington, Lincoln, Madison--are home to some of the most vicious weather recorded on the planet. Howe makes no judgment about those whose misfortunes he chronicles; there are tender moments that manage to stay faithful to a crusty Yankee sensibility, as in the tale of Lizzie Bourne, who died in a snowstorm while huddled in a makeshift lean-to. Howe quotes her uncle George: "She was dead--had uttered no complaint, expressed no regret or fear, but passed silently away." Such sober tales, scrupulously researched, tell the history of a mountain range and its climbers, some of whom are immortalized for their ill-fated treks. It's a gritty read, a touch morbid, but more than compensated for by sharp writing and compelling drama. <i>--Tipton Blish</i>The Presidential Range of New Hampshire is like few places in the world. Located only 150 miles north of a major city, the range is home to beautiful alpine gardens, stunning vistas, and a carefully maintained network of hiking trails. But these same mountains can offer some of the world's worst weather. While the valleys below are bathed in warm sunshine, the exposed summits may be lashed by hurricane-force winds, blinding snows, and numbing cold. Into this potentially deadly environment come hikers, skiers, and climbers by the thousands, drawn by the beauty, accessibility, and history of the mountains. It is a recipe for challenge, adventure - and tragedy. Not Without Peril offers extensive and intimate profiles of twenty-two climbers who found trouble on the Presidential Range from 1849 to 1994. Summer snowstorms, raging rivers, impenetrable fog banks, and a single misplaced step are all part of the dangers awaiting even the most careful hiker. Veteran journalist Nicholas Howe sifted through crumbling archives, interviewed dozens of participants, and hiked the mountains to retrace each fateful journey. The result is a compelling story of our changing relationship with the mountains we love and the risks they pose.

Two-thirds of the Allied camp had shared in the cost of the Wildmages&#x2019; spell, and lay now in their tents stunned into exhaustion, cared for by those who had been exempted from the Price of the spell.<br><br>No one had expected that the Price would be so heavy. If not for Cilarnen, Jermayan, and Kellen managing to blend their magics to shield Idalia from the attack of the Demon Queen Savilla and save the lives of the spell-linked Wildmages, the sacrifice would have been greater still: the lives of all the Elven Army&#x2019;s Wildmages, and perhaps the death of hundreds, even thousands, of fighters.<br><br>But with Shalkan and Ancaladar&#x2019;s help, Wild Magic and High Magick had worked together, though the effort of making them do so had cost Kellen dearly. And the spell had done what they needed it to do: Idalia had seen across Armethalieh&#x2019;s wards and decoded the cryptic warning that it had cost Cilarnen Volpiril so much to bring them. They now knew the specifics of the Demon&#x2019;s foothold in the Golden City.<br><br>Somehow, long ago, Savilla had touched the mind of the young Mageborn Anigrel, corrupting him utterly while he was still a child. All his life Anigrel had worked to one goal: to see the Endarkened gain ultimate power. Though Anigrel&#x2019;s father had been Commonsborn, Anigrel had risen above his lowly birth, becoming Arch-Mage Lycaelon Tavadon&#x2019;s private secretary and tutor to his son, Kellen, all the while worshipping his Dark Lady in secret. When Kellen had been Banished for practicing the Wild Magic, Anigrel&#x2019;s fortunes had continued to rise: Lycaelon had relied upon him more and more, elevating him swiftly through the ranks of Magehood. To increase his clandestine power, Anigrel had invented a conspiracy against the Mage Council, which had resulted in the Banishment of High Mage Volpiril&#x2019;s son, Cilarnen, and the resignation of several members of the High Council. The Arch-Mage, knowing nothing of this, had appointed Anigrel to one of the new vacancies, and adopted him as his son and heir.<br><br>From his new position of power, Anigrel had continued his work, sowing fear and distrust throughout the City against the Elves and the Wildmages, and creating the Magewardens and the Commons Wardens to watch the High Mages and the Commons for any sign of further treason---treason he himself had created. And all along he moved closer to his ultimate goal: removing the ancient and complex wards from the walls of Armethalieh---wards which sealed the City against attack by Demonic magic...<br><br>It was three days before Kellen was able to leave his bed, and at that, he was the first of the Wildmages---other than Idalia, who had not been touched at all by the spell&#x2019;s backlash---to be able to do so.<br><br>He guessed he was just stubborn.<br><br>All his life he&#x2019;d been stubborn. His earliest memories---the ones he knew that were truly his, that hadn&#x2019;t been tampered with by Lycaelon to remove inconvenient memories of his sister Idalia---were of people telling him he was &#x201c;too stubborn&#x201d;---whatever that had meant in terms of life in Armethalieh. Too stubborn to learn his lessons by rote. Too stubborn to be a proper Mage-student and ornament to House Tavadon.<br><br>Later, of course, when he&#x2019;d discovered that he was not only a Wildmage, but a Knight-Mage, he&#x2019;d understood, because a Knight-Mage&#x2019;s most vital tool and weapon was his will. Once a Knight-Mage had made up his (or her---Kellen supposed the Wild Magic could make a female Knight-Mage if it chose, just as there were female Elven Knights) mind to do something, only Death could turn him aside from his purpose. If that wasn&#x2019;t being stubborn, Kellen didn&#x2019;t know what was.<br><br>Being stubborn had saved his life---and the lives of those around him and under his command---more than once since this war began. And it was a war. There could be no doubt in anyone&#x2019;s mind about that now.<br><br>When it had begun---it seemed so long ago, though the establishment of the Black Cairn to keep the rains from falling on the Elven Lands, which marked the first move in the Demons&#x2019; strategy, could hardly have been more than a full turn of the seasons ago---no one had been sure of that. Even after Kellen had destroyed the Cairn, and the Elves had discovered that the Elven Lands were infested with a race of Dark-tainted beings that had lived there, unsuspected, for centuries, they had still not been sure.<br><br>After all, the Elves had fought the Endarkened twice before---the last time a thousand years ago---and each time it had been openly, on the battlefield. Only Kellen had been sure that this was war again, and though the Elves were polite, and certainly respected the fact that he was the first Knight-Mage born in a thousand years, they hadn&#x2019;t been willing to pay a lot of attention to the opinions of a seventeen-year-old boy. Even battle after battle with the Shadowed Elves---with Kellen proving himself in every one---hadn&#x2019;t really changed their minds. Elves lived a thousand years, and they did not hurry. Especially about changing long-held opinions.<br><br>But even before the Wildmages&#x2019; spell, many of them had been changing their minds. Unfortunately, even if they did, it wasn&#x2019;t much help. You couldn&#x2019;t have a war if only one side showed up, and the Endarkened had shown absolutely no interest in taking to the battlefield. They were more than happy to cause droughts, to force the Elves and their Allies to expend their strength in things like cleansing the Elven Lands of the Shadowed Elves, to breed monsters in the Lost Lands and send them out to prey on anything they could reach, but as no one knew where Obsidian Mountain---the Demons&#x2019; stronghold---was, or how to reach it, there was no way for the Allies to carry the war to the Enemy.<br><br>Leaving aside the fact that we&#x2019;re probably outnumbered, and we know that They&#x2019;re more powerful than we are, Kellen thought to himself. Demons were the most powerful Mages there were. All the Allies had to set against them was a handful of Wildmages, and no High Mages at all. In the last war, Armethalieh had fought on the Allied side. But not this time.<br><br>Despite that, the constant doubts and near-despair that Kellen had felt since the beginning were gone. With Idalia&#x2019;s discovery of the traitor within Armethalieh, and the discovery of the Endarkened&#x2019;s strategy, Kellen now knew why the Demons had been refusing to fight openly. Their intention was to subvert Armethalieh and make it fight against the Elves on behalf of the Demons---Light against Light. And then the Demons would destroy the winner.<br><br>Which means that powerful as They are, They&#x2019;re still afraid of us. Which has to mean we have a chance of winning. All we have to do is figure out what it is---and use it.<br><br>It was more effort than he&#x2019;d expected it would be to dress, and for the first time in ages Kellen actually noticed the weight of his Coldwarg-fur cloak when he settled it over his shoulders. But it was unthinkable to brave the outdoors without it---when he&#x2019;d broken the power of the Black Cairn, ending the year-long drought, the weather-patterns had been violently unsettled, and were still returning to normal. One of the side-effects of that was the hardest winter the Elven Lands had seen in centuries---and the coldest and snowiest, too.<br><br>When Kellen stepped out of his pavilion, the cold bit into him like a sword, and he shuddered, pulling his cloak tightly around him. It was sheer stubborn restlessness, he admitted to himself, that had gotten him up and out---that, and the fact that he wanted to see how Cilarnen was doing for himself. Since the Golden City had sealed its gates against the &#x201c;Lesser Races,&#x201d; its name, and that of the High Mages, had been a byword for stupidity and ignorance. Cilarnen had as much to do to prove himself in the wider world as Vestakia did, and in helping to thwart the Demon attack upon Idalia, he&#x2019;d done much to enhance his reputation.<br><br>Cilarnen was still living in the Centaur camp. Idalia had been a frequent visitor to Kellen&#x2019;s bedside, and she&#x2019;d told Kellen that Cilarnen had been taken back there to recover, since the Healer&#x2019;s Tents were still filled with wounded from the Battle for the Heart of the Forest. By the time Kellen had walked there, he considered himself well-served for his rash decision to venture out. He couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time he&#x2019;d felt this exhausted---even poisoned and half-frozen, he hadn&#x2019;t felt quite this hollow-boned.<br><br>Fortunately, most of the rest of the army seemed to be in better shape than he was. Oh, the camp was a great deal quieter than he&#x2019;d ever seen it, and he didn&#x2019;t hear the sounds of drilling on the practice-field, but Kellen merely had the sense that the army was resting, not mortally wounded. And since he had come into his power, he had learned to rely upon those instincts.<br><br>He reached the edge of the Elven encampment and passed over into the Centaur encampment.<br><br>The Elves had their elaborate pavilions, and the Mountainfolk had their sturdy domed tents, but neither design would do for the Centaurfolk. Though in their villages they lived in houses very much like those of the humans with whom they often shared their lives, on campaign, their physical needs were best accommodated by a series of large boxy tents, big enough to hold a dozen Centaurs at once.<br><br>The last time Kellen had been here, he had realized that Andoreniel&#x2019;s people must have constructed all of these tents specially when Andoreniel had summoned the Centaur levies, because the Elves never, but never, went to war in winter, and in summer, the Centaurs would probably simply have slept outdoors. But for a winter campaign---and a hard winter at that---different arrangements had to be made.

Only a matter of time.<br> <br>They&#x2019;re right.<br> <br>Stay sane . . . act normal. Glass in hand, he chuckles softly on his way to a dimly lit table in the back. Normal? He&#x2019;s a goddamned vampire in a bar filled with shifters, demons, and the sharp-eared fey. Christmas lights are strung up in the back&#x2014;through the eye sockets of human skulls that frame a mirror. In the corner, a demoness lazily strokes her lover&#x2019;s horns, visibly arousing the male. At the bar, an immense werewolf bares his fangs, bowing protectively as he tosses a small redhead behind him.<br> <br>Can&#x2019;t decide if you should attack, Lykae? That&#x2019;s right. I don&#x2019;t smell of blood. A trick I learned.<br> <br>The couple leaves, the redhead all but carried out by the Lykae. As they exit, she peers over her shoulder, her eyes like mirrors. Then gone. Out into the night where they belong.<br> <br>Sit. Back against the wall. He adjusts the sunglasses that shade his red eyes, dirty red eyes. As he scans the room, he resists the urge to rub his palm over the back of his neck. Watched by someone unseen?<br> <br>But then, I always feel like that.<br> <br>He swoops up the drink, narrowing his eyes at his steady hand. My mind&#x2019;s decayed, but my sword hand&#x2019;s still true. A ruinous combination.<br> <br>He takes a liberal swallow. The drink. The whiskey dulls the need to lash out. Not that it has disappeared.<br> <br>Small things enrage him. An off look. Someone approaching too quickly. Failing to give him a wide enough berth. His fangs sharpen at the slightest provocation. As though a living thing hungers inside me. Ravenous for blood and a throat to tear. Each time he acts on the rage, others&#x2019; memories blight more of his own.<br> <br>He still has enough sanity to stalk his targets&#x2014;his brothers. He will mete out retribution to Nikolai and Murdoch Wroth for doing the unspeakable to him. Sebastian, the third brother, was a victim like him, but must be slain&#x2014;simply because of what he is.<br> <br>And my time grows nigh. Like an animal, he recognizes this. He&#x2019;s found them in this mysterious place of swamps and haze and music. He&#x2019;s seen Nikolai and Sebastian with their wives. He might have felt envy that his brothers laugh with them. That they touch them possessively, with wonder in their clear eyes. But hatred drowns out any confusing jealousy.<br> <br>Offspring will follow. He&#x2019;ll kill their females as well. Destroy them. Destroy myself. Before my enemies catch up with me.<br> <br>He adjusts the bandage under his shirt on his left arm. The slashed skin beneath it will not heal. Five days ago, he was marked by a dream demon, one who tracks him by this very injury. One who promised that most coveted dream and most dreaded nightmare would follow the mark.<br> <br>His brows draw together. The hunter will soon become the hunted&#x2014;his life is nearing its end.<br> <br>A whisper of regret. The thing he regrets most. He tries to remember what he covets so dearly. Another&#x2019;s memories bombard him, exploding in his mind. His hand shoots up to clasp his forehead&#x2014;<br> <br>Nikolai enters the bar, Murdoch behind him. Their expressions are grave.<br> <br>They&#x2019;ve come to kill me. As he expected. He thought he could draw them out by returning here again and again. He lowers his hand, and his lips ease back from his fangs. The bar empties in a rush.<br> <br>Then . . . stillness. His brothers stare at him as if seeing a ghost. Insects clamor outside. Rain draws near and steeps the air. Just as lightning strikes in the distance, Sebastian enters, crossing to stand beside the other two. He&#x2019;s allied with them? This he hadn&#x2019;t expected.<br> <br>He removes his sunglasses, revealing his red eyes. The eldest, Nikolai, stifles a wince at the sight, but shakes it off and advances. The three seem surprised that he&#x2019;ll stay to engage them, that he hasn&#x2019;t traced away. They are strong and skilled, yet they don&#x2019;t recognize the power he wields, the thing he&#x2019;s become.<br> <br>He can slaughter them all without blinking, and he&#x2019;ll savor it. They haven&#x2019;t drawn their swords? Then they walk to their doom. Can&#x2019;t keep them waiting.<br> <br>He lunges from his seat and hurdles the table, knocking Sebastian unconscious with a blow that cracks his skull and sends him flying into the back wall. Before the other two can raise a hand in defense, he snatches them by their throats. One in each tightening hand as they grapple to free themselves. &#x201c;Three hundred years of this,&#x201d; he hisses. Their struggles do nothing; their shocked expressions satisfy. Squeezing&#x2014;<br> <br>Wood creaks behind him. He shoves back and heaves his brothers at a new enemy. Too late; that Lykae&#x2019;s returned and slashes out with flared claws, ripping through his torso. Blood gushes.<br> <br>He roars with fury and charges the werewolf, dodging claws and teeth with uncanny speed to barrel him to the ground. Just as his hands are about to meet around the Lykae&#x2019;s corded neck, the beast claps something to his right wrist.<br> <br>A manacle? Clenching harder, he grates out a rasping laugh. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think that will hold me?&#x201d; Bones begin to pop beneath his palms. The kill is near, and he wants to yell with pleasure.<br> <br>The werewolf cuffs his left wrist.<br> <br>What is this? The metal won&#x2019;t bend. Won&#x2019;t break. They goddamned mean to take me alive? He leaps to his feet, tensing to trace. Nothing. Sebastian on the floor, pouring blood from his temple, has him by the ankles.<br> <br>He kicks Sebastian, connecting squarely with his brother&#x2019;s chest. Ribs crack. He whirls around&#x2014;in time to catch the bar rail the Lykae swings at his face.<br> <br>He staggers but remains on his feet.<br> <br>&#x201c;What the fuck is he?&#x201d; the Lykae bellows, swinging the rail again with all his might.<br> <br>The brutal hit takes him across his neck. A split second of faltering. Enough for his brothers to tackle him.<br> <br>He thrashes and bites, snapping his fangs. Can&#x2019;t break free . . . can&#x2019;t . . . They attach the manacles at his wrists to another chain. He kicks viciously, stunned when they trap his legs as well.<br> <br>Choking with rage, he strains against his bonds with all his strength. The metal cleaves his skin to the bone. Nothing.<br> <br>Caught. He roars, spitting blood at them, dimly hearing them speak.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope you came up with a good place to put him,&#x201d; Sebastian says between ragged breaths.<br> <br>&#x201c;I bought a long-abandoned manor,&#x201d; Nikolai grates, &#x201c;place called Elancourt.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chills course through him even through his fury; pain erupts from the injury on his arm. A dream. His doom. He can never go to this Elancourt&#x2014;knows this with a savage certainty. He&#x2019;s too strong for them to trace him&#x2014;there&#x2019;s still time to escape.<br> <br>If they take him there, they won&#x2019;t take him alive. . . .<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Under a clouded nighttime sky, the spirit of N�omi Laress knelt in the drive at the very edge of her property line, gazing hungrily at the newspaper, lying wrapped in wet plastic.<br> <br>Today the deliveryman&#x2014;that capricious fiend&#x2014;had missed the drive again, this time tossing the bundle squarely onto the desolate county road.<br> <br>N�omi was starving for that paper, desperate for the news, reviews, and commentary that would break up the monotony of her life&#x2014;or her eighty-year-long afterlife.<br> <br>But she couldn&#x2019;t leave the estate to seize it.

Constance Hale (<i>Wired Style</i>) relishes prose that is deliberate, beautiful, and bold. Go ahead and break the rules, she says; just know the rules first, and know why you are breaking them. In <i>Sin &amp; Syntax</i>, Hale examines the elements of grammar from four angles: the "bones" (the grammar lesson), the "flesh" (the writing lesson), "cardinal sins" (what she calls "true transgressions"), and "carnal pleasures" (the beauty that results from either "hew[ing] exquisitely to the underlying codes of language," or not).<p> For illustration, Hale hails Walt Whitman and Roger Angell, and rails upon Alexander Haig and the Gump's catalogue. She hauls in Joan Didion to make a case for writing in the first person, Mark Twain to promote the killing of adjectives, C.S. Lewis to advocate showing rather than telling, and Loudon Wainwright III to lament the abuse of the word <i>like</i>. But Hale has no problem making her own points. "Euphemisms," she says, "are for wimps." She dismisses a particularly heinous example of scholarly prose as "a bunch of big words thrown into an Osterizer." Even other grammarians don't escape her derision: "Get a grip," Hale says. "<i>Hopefully</i> as a sentence adverb is here to stay." But what distinguishes <i>Sin and Syntax</i> most is its enthusiasm for prose that takes risks. "Even if you have to check with a lawyer," says Hale, "isn't a kick-ass piece of writing worth the effort?" <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>"Move over, grumpy schoolmarms everywhere. Your time has come.

But as MIT physicist and historian David Kaiser reveals, this cutting-edge field has a surprisingly psychedelic past. <em>How the Hippies Saved Physics</em> introduces us to a band of freewheeling physicists who defied the imperative to &#x201c;shut up and calculate&#x201d; and helped to rejuvenate modern physics.<br><br> For physicists, the 1970s were a time of stagnation. Jobs became scarce, and conformity was encouraged, sometimes stifling exploration of the mysteries of the physical world. Dissatisfied, underemployed, and eternally curious, an eccentric group of physicists in Berkeley, California, banded together to throw off the constraints of the physics mainstream and explore the wilder side of science. Dubbing themselves the &#x201c;Fundamental Fysiks Group,&#x201d; they pursued an audacious, speculative approach to physics. They studied quantum entanglement and Bell&#x2019;s Theorem through the lens of Eastern mysticism and psychic mind-reading, discussing the latest research while lounging in hot tubs. Some even dabbled with LSD to enhance their creativity. Unlikely as it may seem, these iconoclasts spun modern physics in a new direction, forcing mainstream physicists to pay attention to the strange but exciting underpinnings of quantum theory.<br><br> A lively, entertaining story that illuminates the relationship between creativity and scientific progress, <em>How the Hippies Saved Physics</em> takes us to a time when only the unlikeliest heroes could break the science world out of its rut. 46 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Advance Praise for <em>How the Hippies Saved Physics:</em><br><br> &#x201c;This book takes us deep into the kaleidoscopic culture of the 1970s&#x2015;with its pop-metaphysicians, dabblers in Eastern mysticism, and counterculture gurus&#x2015;some of whom, it turns out, were also physicists seeking to challenge the foundations of their discipline. In David Kaiser&#x2019;s hands, the story of how they succeeded&#x2015;albeit in ways they never intended&#x2015;makes a tremendously fun and eye-opening tale. As the physicist I. I.

It turns out, as David Kaiser shows, quite a lot. Here is a book that is immensely fun to read, gives insight into deep and increasingly consequential questions of physics, and transports the reader back into the heart of North Beach zaniness in the long 1960s.

In reality, those tests and trials are often profoundly flawed. We like to imagine that doctors who write prescriptions for everything from antidepressants to cancer drugs to heart medication are familiar with the research literature about a drug, when in reality much of the research is hidden from them by drug companies. We like to imagine that doctors are impartially educated, when in reality much of their education is funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We like to imagine that regulators have some code of ethics and let only effective drugs onto the market, when in reality they approve useless drugs, with data on side effects casually withheld from doctors and patients.<br> All these problems have been shielded from public scrutiny because they're too complex to capture in a sound bite. But Ben Goldacre shows that the true scale of this murderous disaster fully reveals itself only when the details are untangled. He believes we should all be able to understand precisely how data manipulation works and how research misconduct in the medical industry affects us on a global scale.<br> With Goldacre's characteristic flair and a forensic attention to detail, <i>Bad Pharma </i>reveals a shockingly broken system and calls for regulation. This is the pharmaceutical industry as it has never been seen before.</p></p><p><b>Ben Goldacre</b> is a doctor and writer. His first book <i>Bad Science</i> was an international bestseller, and has been translated into twenty-five languages. He is thirty-eight and lives in London.1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>Missing Data <br>Sponsors get the answer they want <br>Before we get going, we need to establish one thing beyond any doubt: industry-funded trials are more likely to produce a positive, flattering result than independently funded trials. This is our core premise, and you&#x2019;re about to read a very short chapter, because this is one of the most well-documented phenomena in the growing field of &#x2018;research about research&#x2019;. It has also become much easier to study in recent years, because the rules on declaring industry funding have become a little clearer. <br>We can begin with some recent work: in 2010, three researchers from Harvard and Toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug &#x2013; antidepressants, ulcer drugs and so on &#x2013; then measured two key features: were they positive, and were they funded by industry?1 They found over five hundred trials in total: 85 per cent of the industry-funded studies were positive, but only 50 per cent of the government-funded trials were. That&#x2019;s a very significant difference. <br>In 2007, researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin.2 These are cholesterol-lowering drugs which reduce your risk of having a heart attack, they are prescribed in very large quantities, and they will loom large in this book. This study found 192 trials in total, either comparing one statin against another, or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment. Once the researchers controlled for other factors (we&#x2019;ll delve into what this means later), they found that industry-funded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favouring the test drug. Again, that&#x2019;s a very big difference. <br>We&#x2019;ll do one more. In 2006, researchers looked into every trial of psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a ten-year period, finding 542 trial outcomes in total. Industry sponsors got favourable outcomes for their own drug 78 per cent of the time, while independently funded trials only gave a positive result in 48 per cent of cases. If you were a competing drug put up against the sponsor&#x2019;s drug in a trial, you were in for a pretty rough ride: you would only win a measly 28 per cent of the time.3 <br>These are dismal, frightening results, but they come from individual studies. When there has been lots of research in a field, it&#x2019;s always possible that someone &#x2013; like me, for example &#x2013; could cherry-pick the results, and give a partial view. I could, in essence, be doing exactly what I accuse the pharmaceutical industry of doing, and only telling you about the studies that support my case, while hiding the reassuring ones from you. <br>To guard against this risk, researchers invented the systematic review. We&#x2019;ll explore this in more detail soon (here), since it&#x2019;s at the core of modern medicine, but in essence a systematic review is simple: instead of just mooching through the research literature, consciously or unconsciously picking out papers here and there that support your pre-existing beliefs, you take a scientific, systematic approach to the very process of looking for scientific evidence, ensuring that your evidence is as complete and representative as possible of all the research that has ever been done. <br>Systematic reviews are very, very onerous. In 2003, by coincidence, two were published, both looking specifically at the question we&#x2019;re interested in. They took all the studies ever published that looked at whether industry funding is associated with pro-industry results. Each took a slightly different approach to finding research papers, and both found that industry-funded trials were, overall, about four times more likely to report positive results.4 A further review in 2007 looked at the new studies that had been published in the four years after these two earlier reviews: it found twenty more pieces of work, and all but two showed that industry-sponsored trials were more likely to report flattering results.5 <br>I am setting out this evidence at length because I want to be absolutely clear that there is no doubt on the issue. Industry-sponsored trials give favourable results, and that is not my opinion, or a hunch from the occasional passing study. This is a very well-documented problem, and it has been researched extensively, without anybody stepping out to take effective action, as we shall see. <br>There is one last study I&#x2019;d like to tell you about. It turns out that this pattern of industry-funded trials being vastly more likely to give positive results persists even when you move away from published academic papers, and look instead at trial reports from academic conferences, where data often appears for the first time (in fact, as we shall see, sometimes trial results only appear at an academic conference, with very little information on how the study was conducted). <br>Fries and Krishnan studied all the research abstracts presented at the 2001 American College of Rheumatology meetings which reported any kind of trial, and acknowledged industry sponsorship, in order to find out what proportion had results that favoured the sponsor&#x2019;s drug. There is a small punchline coming, and to understand it we need to cover a little of what an academic paper looks like. In general, the results section is extensive: the raw numbers are given for each outcome, and for each possible causal factor, but not just as raw figures. The &#x2018;ranges&#x2019; are given, subgroups are perhaps explored, statistical tests are conducted, and each detail of the result is described in table form, and in shorter narrative form in the text, explaining the most important results. This lengthy process is usually spread over several pages. <br>In Fries and Krishnan [2004] this level of detail was unnecessary. The results section is a single, simple, and &#x2013; I like to imagine &#x2013; fairly passive-aggressive sentence: <br>The results from every RCT (45 out of 45) favored the drug of the sponsor. <br>This extreme finding has a very interesting side effect, for those interested in time-saving shortcuts. Since every industry-sponsored trial had a positive result, that&#x2019;s all you&#x2019;d need to know about a piece of work to predict its outcome: if it was funded by industry, you could know with absolute certainty that the trial found the drug was great. <br>How does this happen? How do industry-sponsored trials almost always manage to get a positive result? It is, as far as anyone can be certain, a combination of factors. It may be that companies are more likely to run trials when they&#x2019;re most confident their treatment is going to &#x2018;win&#x2019;: this sounds reasonable, although even it conflicts with the ethical principle that you should only do a trial when there&#x2019;s genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best (otherwise you&#x2019;re exposing half of your participants to a treatment you already know to be inferior). Sometimes the chances of one treatment winning can be increased by outright design flaws. You can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish &#x2013; an existing drug at an inadequate dose, perhaps, or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing. You can choose your patients very carefully, so they are more likely to get better on your treatment. You can peek at the results halfway through, and stop your trial early if they look good (which is &#x2013; for interesting reasons we shall discuss &#x2013; statistical poison). And so on. <br>But before we get to these fascinating methodological twists and quirks, these nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test of whether a treatment works or not, there is something very much simpler at hand. <br>Sometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them. This is not a new problem, and it&#x2019;s not limited to medicine. In fact, this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science. It distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics, it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies, and despite everything that regulators, drug companies and even some academics will tell you, it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades. <br>In fact, it is so deep-rooted that even if we fixed it today &#x2013; right now, for good, forever, without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation &#x2013; that still wouldn&#x2019;t help, because we would still be practising medicine, cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best, on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is &#x2013; as you&#x2019;ve now seen &#x2013; fundamentally distorted. <br>But there is a way ahead. <br>Why missing data matters <br>Reboxetine is a drug I myself have prescribed. Other drugs had done nothing for this particular patient, so we wanted to try something new. I&#x2019;d read the trial data before I wrote the prescription, and found only well-designed, fair tests, with overwhelmingly positive results. Reboxetine was better than placebo, and as good as any other antidepressant in head-to-head comparisons. It&#x2019;s approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the MHRA) in the UK, but wisely, the US FDA chose not to approve it. (This is no proof of the FDA being any smarter; there are plenty of drugs available in the US that the UK never approved.) Reboxetine was clearly a safe and and effective treatment. The patient and I discussed the evidence briefly, and agreed it was the right treatment to try next. I signed a prescription saying I wanted my patient to have this drug. <br>But we had both been misled. In October 2010 a group of researchers were finally able to bring together all the trials that had ever been conducted on reboxetine.6 Through a long process of investigation &#x2013; searching in academic journals, but also arduously requesting data from the manufacturers and gathering documents from regulators &#x2013; they were able to assemble all the data, both from trials that were published, and from those that had never appeared in academic papers. <br>When all this trial data was put together it produced a shocking picture. Seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against placebo. Only one, conducted in 254 patients, had a neat, positive result, and that one was published in an academic journal, for doctors and researchers to read. But six more trials were conducted, in almost ten times as many patients. All of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill. None of these trials was published. I had no idea they existed. <br>It got worse. The trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture: three small studies, 507 patients in total, showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug. They were all published. But 1,657 patients&#x2019; worth of data was left unpublished, and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs. If all this wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, there was also the side-effects data. The drug looked fine in the trials which appeared in the academic literature: but when we saw the unpublished studies, it turned out that patients were more likely to have side effects, more likely to drop out of taking the drug, and more likely to withdraw from the trial because of side effects, if they were taking reboxetine rather than one of its competitors. <br>If you&#x2019;re ever in any doubt about whether the stories in this book make me angry &#x2013; and I promise you, whatever happens, I will keep to the data, and strive to give a fair picture of everything we know &#x2013; you need only look at this story. I did everything a doctor is supposed to do. I read all the papers, I critically appraised them, I understood them, I discussed them with the patient, and we made a decision together, based on the evidence. In the published data, reboxetine was a safe and effective drug. In reality, it was no better than a sugar pill, and worse, it does more harm than good. As a doctor I did something which, on the balance of all the evidence, harmed my patient, simply because unflattering data was left unpublished. <br>If you find that amazing, or outrageous, your journey is just beginning. Because nobody broke any law in that situation, reboxetine is still on the market, and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play, for all drugs, in all countries in the world. Negative data goes missing, for all treatments, in all areas of science. The regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us. <br>In a few pages, we will walk through the literature that demonstrates all of this beyond any doubt, showing that &#x2018;publication bias&#x2019; &#x2013; the process whereby negative results go unpublished &#x2013; is endemic throughout the whole of medicine and academia; and that regulators have failed to do anything about it, despite decades of data showing the size of the problem. But before we get to that research, I need you to feel its implications, so we need to think about why missing data matters. <br>Evidence is the only way we can possibly know if something works &#x2013; or doesn&#x2019;t work &#x2013; in medicine. We proceed by testing things, as cautiously as we can, in head-to-head trials, and gathering together <i>all</i> of the evidence. This last step is crucial: if I withhold half the data from you, it&#x2019;s very easy for me to convince you of something that isn&#x2019;t true. If I toss a coin a hundred times, for example, but only tell you about the results when it lands heads-up, I can convince you that this is a two-headed coin. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean I really do have a two-headed coin: it means I&#x2019;m misleading you, and you&#x2019;re a fool for letting me get away with it. This is exactly the situation we tolerate in medicine, and always have. Researchers are free to do as many trials as they wish, and then choose which ones to publish. <br>The repercussions of this go way beyond simply misleading doctors about the benefits and harms of interventions for patients, and way beyond trials. Medical research isn&#x2019;t an abstract academic pursuit: it&#x2019;s about people, so every time we fail to publish a piece of research we expose real, living people to unnecessary, avoidable suffering. <br> <i>TGN1412</i> <br>In March 2006, six volunteers arrived at a London hospital to take part in a trial. It was the first time a new drug called TGN1412 had ever been given to humans, and they were paid �2,000 each.7 Within an hour these six men developed headaches, muscle aches, and a feeling of unease. Then things got worse: high temperatures, restlessness, periods of forgetting who and where they were. Soon they were shivering, flushed, their pulses racing, their blood pressure falling. Then, a cliff: one went into respiratory failure, the oxygen levels in his blood falling rapidly as his lungs filled with fluid. Nobody knew why. Another dropped his blood pressure to just 65/40, stopped breathing properly, and was rushed to an intensive care unit, knocked out, intubated, mechanically ventilated. Within a day all six were disastrously unwell: fluid on their lungs, struggling to breathe, their kidneys failing, their blood clotting uncontrollably throughout their bodies, and their white blood cells disappearing. Doctors threw everything they could at them: steroids, antihistamines, immune-system receptor blockers. All six were ventilated on intensive care. They stopped producing urine; they were all put on dialysis; their blood was replaced, first slowly, then rapidly; they needed plasma, red cells, platelets. The fevers continued.

Beyond Kekon&#39;s borders, war is brewing. Powerful foreign governments and mercenary criminal kingpins alike turn their eyes on the island nation. Jade, Kekon&#39;s most prized resource, could make them rich - or give them the edge they&#39;d need to topple their rivals. Faced with threats on all sides, the Kaul family is forced to form new and dangerous alliances, confront enemies in the darkest streets and the tallest office towers, and put honor aside in order to do whatever it takes to ensure their own survival - and that of all the Green Bones of Kekon. Jade War is the second book of the Green Bone Saga, an epic trilogy about family, honour and those who live and die by the ancient laws of blood and jade.</p><p></p><h2>You Are the Mother of All Mothers - A Message of Hope for the Grieving Heart</h2><p>Book is in great condition.

Brown has written, "and the effects of his genius have been felt in many fields: linguistics, semiotics, art, structural anthropology, and, of course, literature." At every stage in his odyssey from Moscow to Prague to Denmark and then to the United States, he formed collaborative efforts that changed the very nature of each discipline he touched. This book is the first comprehensive presentation in English of Jakobson's major essays on the intertwining of language and literature: here the reader will learn how it was that Jakobson became legendary.</p><p>Jakobson reveals himself as one of the great explorers of literary art in our day--a critic who revealed the avant-garde thrust of even the most worked-over poets, such as Shakespeare and Pushkin, and enabled the reader to see them as the innovators they were. Jakobson takes the reader from literature to grammar and then back again, letting points of structural detail throw a sharp light on the underlying form and linking thereby the most disparate realms into a coherent whole. In his essays we can also learn to appreciate his search for a fully systematic, nonmetaphysical understanding of the workings of literature: Jakobson made possible a deep structural analysis that did not exist before.</p><p>Among the essential items in this collection are such classics as "Linguistics and Poetics" and "On a Generation That Squandered Its Poets" and illuminations of Baudelaire, Yeats, Turgenev, Pasternak, and Blake, as well as the famous pieces on Shakespeare and Pushkin. The essays include fundamental theoretical statements, structural analyses of individual poems, explorations of the connections between poetry and experience, and semiotic perspectives on the structure of verbal and nonverbal art. This will become a basic book for contemplating the function of language in literature--a project that will continue to engross the keenest readers.</p></p><p>Roman Jakobson (1896-1982) was at the time of his death Professor Emeritus at Harvard University and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Jakobson--co-founder of both the Moscow and Prague Linguistic Circles early in the century; friend of Mayakovsky, Khlebnikov, Pasternak; brilliant teacher in the U.S.--was one of the century's great intellectuals. His collected work stands published for scholars, but here are the essays--on Pasternak, on Blake, on Baudelaire's <i>Le Chat</i>, on aphasia and metaphor, on Hopkins, on statuary in Pushkin--that are legends of scientific criticism...Indispensable for anyone interested in the meanings and powers of language. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>Roman Jakobson has given us a marvelous gift: he has given linguistics to artists. It is he who has opened up the live and sensitive juncture between one of the most exact of the sciences of man and the creative world. He represents, both for his theoretical thought and for his actual accomplishments, the meeting of scientific thought and the creative spirit. (Roland Barthes)<br><br>Roman Jakobson has made a dramatic and enduring contribution to twentieth-century poetics and semiotics. This collection is as strategic as it is comprehensive. To my knowledge, not a single essential item has been omitted. In deference to the richness and scope of Jakobson's achievement, a wide net has been cast.

These participants, men and women, famous and ordinary, tell stories that add immeasurably to our understanding of that cataclysmic time. One Soviet soldier recounts that, surrounded by the Germans, his comrades tapped the powder from their last cartridges and inserted notes to their families inside the casings; Russian children, he goes on, still turn these up every now and again and deliver the notes to the soldiers&#39; families. Terkel touches on many themes along the way, including institutionalized racism in the United States military, the birth of the military-industrial complex, and the origins of the Cold War."A work of remarkable power and sensitivity...deeply moving and profoundly important...Studs Terkel has produced a work that is not only his finest oral history to date, but also the richest and most powerful single document of the American experience in World War Two I have ever read."--Alan Brinkley, The Boston Globe<br><br>"I promise you will remember your war years, if you were alive then, with extraordinary vividness as you go through Studs Terkel's book. Or, if you are too young to remember, this is the best place to get a sense of what people were feeling."--Garry Wills, Chicago Tribune Book World<br><br>"Tremendously compelling, somehow dramatic and intimate at the same time, as if one has stumbled on private accounts in letters long locked in attic trunks...Mr. Terkel's book gives the American experience in World War Two great immediacy...In terms of plain human interest, Mr. Terkel may well have put together the most vivid collection of World War Two sketches ever gathered between covers."--Loudon Wainwright, The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Incontestably one of the great human documents of all time. It has the essence and cumulative force of a hundred powerful war novels, without drawing on a single word of fiction. Among major historians Terkel is now in orbit all by himself, world class."--Norman Corwin<br><br>"Read this important book."--The Philadelphia Inquirer</p><h2>Surviving the Island of Grace: Life on the Wild Edge of America</h2><p>Reminiscent of the best of Matthiessen, Dillard, and Erlich, Leslie Leyland Fields's Alaskan memoir is an inspiring narrative of life in the wild. <br>"Surviving the Island of Grace" is a beautiful and haunting memoir of a woman who left the East Coast and moved to Alaska looking for a new life. In brilliant prose, Leslie Fields tells her story of adapting to life on a wilderness island without running water, telephones, or other 20th century conveniences. Here, as a 20-year-old newlywed, she is immersed into the world of commercial salmon fishing. With an unflinching gaze, she explores the extremes that define her new life: the beauty and brutality of commercial fishing, the startling land and seascape around her, the isolation, the physical labor, the intensity of communal island life. Among these extremes, she must find her way from a young woman to wife, commercial fisherwoman, and mother. She explores as well, perhaps most eloquently of all, her unique New Hampshire childhood and its role in preparing her for her life in the bush. <br>With its dramatic Alaskan setting and moving narrative, "Surviving the Island of Grace" is a poetic and powerful book.<br></p><p>This is a powerfully rendered story of a twenty-year-old newlywed transplanted from New Hampshire to a remote island in the immense Gulf of Alaska. Here, she must learn to live communally with her new family in primitive conditions without running water, electricity, or contact with the outside world. Even more challenging, she enters the dangerous and exhausting world of commercial salmon fishing. With an unflinching gaze, the author writes incisively about her first fifteen seasons on the island, exploring paradoxes of wilderness living, her changing spirituality, her difficult transition from young woman to wife and mother, and her unsual childhood that prepared her for this uncommon life.<br>LESLIE LEYLAND FIELDS is a writer, national speaker, workshop leader and professional editor who lives on Kodiak Island, Alaska in the winter and Harvester Island in the summer, where she works in commercial salmon fishing with her family.

The music of a four-piece orchestra drifted upward from the drawing room downstairs. The house party, a gala event that had cost a small fortune, was an other of her mother's unending attempts to fob her off on one of the <em>ton</em>'s aged aristocrats. Grace had stayed as long as she dared, forcing herself to make dreary conversation with her mother's guests, then pled a headache and retired upstairs. She had urgent business to attend this night.<br><br>Outside the window, a winter wind whipped leafless branches against the sill as Grace stripped off her long white gloves. Her palms were sweating. Uncertainty coiled like a snake in her stomach, but her course was set and she refused to turn back now.<br><br>Hurrying toward the bellpull, she kicked off her kid-skin slippers along the way, rang for her lady's maid, then reached up to work the clasp on the diamond-and-pearl necklace around her neck. Her hand lingered there, testing the smoothness of the pearls, the rough facets of the diamonds set in between each one.<br><br>The necklace had been a gift from her best friend, Victoria Easton, countess of Brant, and Grace treasured it, her only possession of any real worth.<br><br>"You rang, miss?" Her maid, Phoebe Bloom, was a bit of a featherhead at times but good-hearted nonetheless. She poked her dark-haired head through the door, then hurried in.<br><br>"I could use a little help, Phoebe, if you please."<br><br>"Of course, miss."<br><br>It didn't take long to get out of the gown. Grace managed a nervous smile for Phoebe, pulled on her quilted wrapper, and excused the girl for the balance of the evening. The music downstairs continued to play. Grace prayed she could complete her mission and return to the house before anyone discovered she was gone.<br><br>The moment Phoebe closed the door, Grace tossed aside her robe and hurriedly changed into a simple gray wool gown. She blew out the whale oil lamp on the dresser and the one beside the bed, leaving the room in darkness. Stuffing a pillow beneath the covers to create the illusion that she was sleeping if her mother chanced to look in, she grabbed her cloak and swung it around her shoulders.<br><br>As she headed for the door, she picked up her reticule, the purse heavy with the weight of the money she had received from her great-aunt, Matilda Crenshaw, Baroness Humphrey, along with a ticket for a cabin aboard a packet sailing north at the end of the week.<br><br>Raising the hood of her cloak to cover her auburn hair, Grace checked to be certain no one was out in the hall, then slipped down the servants' stairs and left the house through a door leading out to the garden.<br><br>Her heart was pumping, her nerves on edge, by the time she reached Brook Street, hailed a hackney carriage and climbed into the passenger seat.<br><br>"The Hare and Fox Tavern, if you please," she said to the driver, hoping he wouldn't hear the tremor in her voice.<br><br>"That be in Covent Garden, eh, miss?"<br><br>"That is correct." It was a small, out-of-the-way establishment, she had been told, chosen by the man whose services she intended to purchase. She had gleaned the man's name from her coachman for a few gold sovereigns, though she didn't tell him the nature of her business.<br><br>It seemed to take hours to reach her destination, the hackney winding through the dark London streets, wooden wheels whirring, the horse's hooves clopping over the cobbles, but finally the painted sign for the Hare and Fox appeared.<br><br>"I'd like you to wait," Grace said to the driver as the coach pulled up in front, pressing a handful of coins into his palm. "I won't be inside very long."<br><br>The driver nodded, a grizzled old man whose face was mostly hidden beneath a growth of heavy gray beard. "See that ye aren't."<br><br>Praying the man would still be there when she returned, and careful to keep the hood of her cloak up over her head, she made her way around to the back of the tavern as she had been instructed, opened the creaky wooden door and stepped into the dimly lit taproom. The place was low-ceil inged and smoky, with heavy carved beams and scarred wooden tables. A fire blazed in a blackened stone hearth and a group of hard-looking men sat at a nearby table. At the back of the room, a tall, big-boned man in a slouch hat and greatcoat sat at another of the tables. He stood as she walked in and motioned for her to join him.<br><br>Grace swallowed and dragged in a courage-building breath, then made her way toward him, ignoring the curious glances of the men in the tavern as she took a seat in the ladder-back chair he offered.<br><br>"Did ye bring the blunt?" he asked without the least formality.<br><br>"Are you certain you can see the job done?" Grace was equally forward.<br><br>He straightened as if she'd insulted him. "Jack Moody gives his word, ye can count on it. Ye'll get what ye pay for."<br><br>Grace's hand shook as she pulled the pouch out of her reticule and handed it to the man named Jack Moody. He poured a fistful of golden guineas into his palm, a dark smile lifting a thin pair of lips.<br><br>"It's all there," Grace said, trying to ignore the bawdy jokes and coarse laughter of the men at the table next to them, glad they were mostly occupied with their drinking and the lusty tavern wenches who seemed to keep them entertained. The smell of greasy mutton made her stomach roll and Grace felt a sweep of nausea. She had never done anything like this before. She prayed she would never have to again.<br><br>Jack Moody counted the coins, then dumped them back into the pouch. "As ye say, seems t'all be there." He rose to his feet, his features partly shadowed by the narrow brim of his hat. "The plan's been set. Soon as I give the word, t'will be done. Yer man'll be well outta London come mornin'."<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>Jack hefted the pouch, making the coins rattle. "This be all the thanks I need." He tipped his head toward the door. "Best get along now. Later it gets, more chance of trouble findin' ye."<br><br>Grace said nothing to that, just rose from the chair and cast a cautious glance at the door.<br><br>"Mind ye keep yer silence, lass. Them what talks when they shouldn't don't live very long."<br><br>A chill went through her. She would never mention Jack Moody's name again. With a faint nod of understanding, she drew her cloak around her and made her way silently out the back door.<br><br>The alley was dark and smelled of rotten fish. Mud squished beneath the soles of her ankle boots. Lifting her skirt and the hem of her cloak out of the way, she hurried through the darkness, her gaze darting back and forth in search of trouble. Once she reached the front of the tavern, she caught sight of the hackney carriage and the old man sitting on the driver's seat, and released a momentary sigh of relief.<br><br>The trip home seemed an even longer journey. The lights were still blazing in the windows of her family's town house as she made her way through the garden. Hurriedly climbing the servants' stairs, she slipped down the hall and into her bedchamber. The orchestra had stopped playing, but she could still hear a burst of occasional laughter as the last of the guests departed.<br><br>Grace sighed as she untied her cloak and returned it to its hook beside the door. At the end of the week, she would be leaving the house herself, traveling to Scarborough to visit Lady Humphrey, though the two of them had never met. If the escape tonight went as planned, the outrage that would erupt all over London in the morning would be of momentous proportions. Though she wouldn't leave for a couple of days, a lengthy journey seemed propitious.<br><br>Grace thought of the man in Newgate prison, Viscount Forsythe, who languished in a dank cell, counting the hours until dawn when he would climb the wooden stairs to the gallows. She didn't know whether he was innocent or guilty, didn't know whether or not he deserved the sentence he had been given.<br><br>But the viscount was her father and though no one knew the truth of their relationship, nothing could change the fact. He was her father and she simply couldn't abandon him.<br><br>Grace stared up at the ceiling above her bed and prayed she had done the right thing.<br><br><em>One Week Later</em><br><br>"I see her, Capt'n! The <em>Lady</em><em> </em><em>Anne!</em><em> </em>She's there...just off starboard, left o' the foremast."<br><br>Standing next to his first mate, Angus McShane, Captain Ethan Sharpe swung his worn brass spyglass in the direction Angus pointed. Through the darkness, the lens caught the gleam of distant yellow lights shining through a row of windows at the stern of the ship.<br><br>Ethan's fingers tightened around the glass as he surveyed his quarry. An icy wind blew over the deck, ruffling his thick black hair, numbing the skin over his cheekbones, but he barely noticed. At last his prey was in sight and nothing was going to keep him from it.<br><br>"Come about, Mr. McShane. Set a course to intercept the <em>Lady Anne.</em>"<br><br>"Aye, Capt'n." The weathered Scotsman had been in his employ since Ethan had commanded his first vessel. Carrying out Ethan's direction, the old sea dog ambled across the deck spouting orders to the crew, and the lads set to work. The sails began to flutter, luffing, then refilling with wind. The rigging clattered and clanked as the <em>Sea Devil </em>came about; the heavy ship's timbers groaned, then the hull settled into its proper course and sliced cleanly through the water.<br><br>The schooner was eighty feet long, sleek and fast, skimming through the waves as effortlessly as the sea lions who followed in her wake. She was built of seasoned oak in the best shipyard in Portsmouth, designed for a merchant unable to come up with the funds once the schooner was complete.<br><br>Ethan had stepped in and purchased the vessel at a more than reasonable price, though he knew he would only have brief need of it. One last mission, one final assignment before he assumed the duties of his newly acquired position as marquess of Belford.<br><br>One last bit of personal business that wouldn't let him rest until he saw it done.<br><br>His jaw hardened. The <em>Sea Devil </em>was the second ship he'd commanded since he had relinquished his naval commission eight years ago and begun a career as a British privateer.<br><br>He had commanded the <em>Sea Witch </em>then, a similarly well-equipped vessel manned by the best crew a man could have. His men were gone now, lost in battle or dead in a stinking French prison, the <em>Sea Witch </em>rotting in an icy grave at the bottom of the sea.<br><br>Ethan closed his mind to the memory. His men were gone, all but Angus, who had been away in Scotland caring for an ailing mother, and Long-boned Ned, who had managed to escape the French pigs who had taken the ship and make his way back to Portsmouth.<br><br>Ethan's men captured and killed, his ship gone, and though he still lived, eleven months of his nine-and-twenty years stolen from him. He carried a slight limp and the scars of his endless months in confinement. Someone would pay and pay dearly, Ethan silently vowed as he had a thousand times.<br><br>His hand unconsciously fisted.<br><br>And that someone rode now aboard the <em>Lady Anne.</em><br><br>Grace Chastain took the high-backed, carved wooden chair held for her by Martin Tully, earl of Collingwood. The earl, a slender, attractive man in his early thirties with light brown hair and a fair complexion, was a fellow passenger. Grace had met him on her first night aboard the <em>Lady Anne, </em>the packet carrying her from London to Scarborough, where Grace planned a long stay with her great-aunt, the Dowager Baroness Humphrey.<br><br>Lady Humphrey, Grace's father's aunt, had extended an offer of assistance should it ever be needed. Grace had never expected to accept such an offer, but the matter of her father's imprisonment had drastically altered her circumstances, and she had accepted her great-aunt's help and money enough to free her father.<br><br>Grace prayed that by the time she returned to London, matters would have settled down. She prayed no word of her involvement in her father's escape a week earlier had surfaced and she would be safe.<br><br>The door of the salon swung open. She looked up to see Captain Chambers enter the elegant, wood-paneled room. An older man, short and stout with thinning gray hair, he waited till the rest of the passengers were seated, then took his place at the head of the linen-draped table, the signal for a pair of uniformed crewmen to begin serving the meal.<br><br>"Good evening, everyone."<br><br>"Good evening, Captain," replied the group in unison.<br><br>Since Grace and her lady's maid, Phoebe Bloom, had been traveling aboard the packet for the past several days, the shipboard routine was no longer daunting. And the passengers, especially Lord Collingwood, had all been agreeable company.<br><br>Grace flicked a glance at the earl, who sat beside her at the long mahogany table, chatting pleasantly with the woman to his right, Mrs. Cogburn, a plump matron traveling north to visit her brother. Mrs. Cogburn was a widow, as was Mrs. Franklin, her companion. Also seated at the table were a wealthy silk merchant from Bath and a newly married couple on their way to visit relatives in Scotland.<br><br>Lord Collingwood laughed at something Mrs. Cogburn said then casually shifted his attention to her. His eyes ran over her aqua silk gown, took in the auburn curls swept high on her head, lingered a moment on her bosom, then returned to her face.<br><br>"If I might say so, you look particularly fetching tonight, Miss Chastain."<br><br>"Thank you, my lord."<br><br>"And those pearls you are wearing...they're quite unusual. I don't believe I have ever seen a string so perfectly matched or of such a rich color."<br><br>Unconsciously her hand came up to the strand of pearls at her throat. The necklace was worth a fortune, a gift Grace probably should have refused, but Tory had insisted, and the necklace was so lovely. The moment Grace had put it on, she simply hadn't been able to resist.<br><br>"They're very old," Grace told the earl. "Thirteenth century. There's a rather tragic story behind them."<br><br>"Really? Perhaps you will tell me sometime."<br><br>"I would be happy to."<br><br></p><h2>More Craftsman Homes (Dover Architecture)</h2><p>Gustav Stickley (1858&#x2013;1942) &#x2014; leader of the American Arts and Crafts Movement, publisher of <i>The Craftsman</i>, writer, innovator, and famous furniture manufacturer &#x2014; created designs for a new form of American home. Based on beauty, simplicity, utility, and organic harmony, these designs were to have lasting impression on the shape, look, feel, and rationale of American domestic architecture.<br>Many of the features advocated by Stickley exist today: split-levels, semi-partitions, an integration of structure with natural surroundings, and the primacy of form following function. Here, in 345 crisp black-and-white illustrations, are 78 authentic Mission style dwellings. These are the plans that Stickley himself approved &#x2014; reprinted directly from the original 1912 publications &#x2014; and include illustrations of the exteriors and interiors, floor plans, elevations, structural suggestions, landscape designs, and Stickley's own inimitable comments.<br>Deeply influenced by the English Arts and Crafts Movement, especially the writings of John Ruskin and William Morris, Stickley rebelled against the outmoded architectural traditions of the Victorian age. Instead of creating rooms that were a series of separate cells, he proposed letting one living area flow smoothly into the other; instead of imitating the styles of 19th-century Europe, he proposed an original and vital American style, all the while searching for a new vocabulary of exterior and interior design. His method was the simplification of architectural space and the elimination of superfluous ornamentation; his aim was a harmonious blend of utility, economy, and aesthetics.<br>The ideal of the Craftsman home was an honest and beautiful building, well planned for efficient use of space and materials, built to last several generations, and within the means of the average family. Craftsman architecture adhered to four basic principles: a style of building suited to the ways people actually lived; having the best structural outline and the simplest form; made from materials that belong to the countryside in which the house was built and in harmony with the landscape; and rendered in colors that please and cheer. For Stickley, the true beauty of a building was not a matter of decoration &#x2014; a something to be added &#x2014; but was inherent in the very lines and masses of the structure itself.<br>This excellent republication of Gustav Stickley's <i>More Craftsman Homes</i> affords a fresh look at an influential and thoroughly American style of design and construction. Today's architects, designers, decorators, and collectors of Americana will find in the text and illustrations of this volume sufficient information and insight to appreciate the Craftsman home, the Craftsman idea, and that innovative spirit who made it possible, Gustav Stickley.</p><p>Furniture maker and architect Gustav Stickley (1858-1942) was a leading spokesman for the American Craftsman movement, a design trend descended directly from the British Arts and Crafts movement.</p><h2>Red Storm Rising</h2><p>Shows some signs of wear, and may have some markings on the inside. 100% Money Back Guarantee.</p><p>Using the latest advancements in military technology, the world's superpowers battle it out on land, sea, and air for the ultimate global control.

Desperate to rid himself of a malady that has somehow managed to elude conventional medicine, Leland turns to homeopath Carissa Lake--who cures both his sore throat and the aching loneliness at the root of his symptoms. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Just days after Leland realizes he has fallen in love with the first woman who has mattered to him since his wife, one of Carissa's asthma patients falls into an allergy-induced coma. When Carissa comes under investigation, straight-arrow Leland is faced with a moral and ethical dilemma of enormous proportions. <br><br>Set against the ongoing clash between conventional and alternative medicine--between what we know science can offer and the miracles that always seem to be just beyond our reach--<b>The Law of Similars</b> is a&nbsp;&nbsp;haunting and deeply atmospheric tale.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Chris Bohjalian is known for the compassion and grace that mark his characters as well as for the sheer storytelling power that propels his fiction. With <b>The Law of Similars</b>, he has offered something more: a page-turning examination of the fragile threads that hold people together when the worst that can happen really does...and the unexpected and luminous ways we are made well. It is a remarkable achievement.</p><p>In Chris Bohjalian's fine follow-up to <i>Midwives</i>, individual judgment and the unconventional again clash with the medical and legal forces of tradition. In rural Vermont, two years after his wife's sudden death, an exhausted state's attorney can hope for little but a quiet life with his 4-year-old daughter. Leland Fowler's only goal is a cure for the common cold--his own, that is, which has dragged on for months. As it turns out, his appointment with the town's only homeopath will set to rights his physical <i>and</i> emotional symptoms. At least for a while.<p> Alas, another of Carissa Lake's patients isn't quite so lucky. Despite her warning that Richard Emmons not go off his prescription drugs, he does exactly that. In fact, during an asthma attack, he takes the homeopathic law of similars--the belief that "like cures like"--to an entirely new level. This tragedy embroils Carissa in an investigation of her practice and forces Leland into a decision that is to alter not only her life but his: </p><blockquote> Upstairs, my daughter slept. And for a long time we sat on the floor before the tree, neither of us saying a word, as I worked out in my mind exactly what I would have needed to prosecute this case if a summer cold had not lasted into the fall, and I had not met Carissa Lake.

Under the tutelage of North Carolina fiber artist Allen, crafters new to weaving will find much of the mystique dissipated, thanks to clear, no-nonsense directions and a well-defined glossary. What truly makes this a practical text is, first, the proliferation of color-photographed examples, and, second, the dozen projects. Except for the loom (which can be rented or borrowed in metropolitan areas), few of the necessary materials will break the bank--and Allen actively encourages recycling. Plus, the patterns, though somewhat complicated, are not as primitive as random rag rugs; it is clear that a bit of weaving practice could eventually add brightness to a dark floor or corner. Appended are a glossary, a listing of contributing artists, and additional resources. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i>The humble rag rug has long been a mainstay of country crafters. Made of a weft of recycled clothing or other rags hand-woven through a thread warp, these rugs are washable and generally utilitarian. Designs are often simple stripes or "hit and miss," using the colors as they occur in the rags. Contemporary artists now weave rag rugs in patterns using a technique similar to tapestry. Allen presents all the basics of equipment, weaving, and designing through line drawings interspersed with color photographs of finished rugs by other artists. Step-by-step instructions are given for 12 rug projects. This is an excellent new look at an old favorite.

He attended Oxford, and at age twenty-one received England's highest academic honor, becoming the youngest Fellow of All Soul's College in its history. A prolific writer, Harvey is the author of over ten books, including Journey to Ladakh (1983). He collaborated with Sogyal Rinpoche on the bestselling Tibetan Book of Living and Dying (1991), which presents the Tibetan Buddhist view of death and the nature of the mind.<br>Despite his success as a scholar, educator, writer, and poet, Harvey experienced intense dissatisfaction at the disparities and inequities of the patriarchal, rationalist Western tradition and longed for the spiritual richness of his boyhood in India. In 1977 he returned to India and immersed himself in its culture, philosophy, and spirituality, studying at the ashram of the Bengali mystic Sri Aurobindo. The next year Harvey traveled to Pondicherry to meet Kamala Reddy (Mother Meera), an Indian woman then only seventeen years old who her followers believe is an avatar, a living incarnation of the Divine Presence. With Mother Meera Harvey underwent a series of profound mystical experiences, but remained reticent to commit to her as his spiritual mentor. He returned to the West and taught in the United States for the next seven years while continuing to make regular pilgrimages to India. There, Harvey studied with the Tibetan Buddhist Master Thuksey Rinpoche. In 1986 he presented himself to Mother Meera and lived for a year at her home in Germany. His critically acclaimed Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening (1991) describes his work with the Divine Mother, and brought international attenion to master and disciple. Based now in Paris, Harvey is the subject of a 1993 documentary, The Making of a Mystic.<br>The Way of Passion: A Celebration of Rumi follows Harvey's Love's Fire (1988) and Speaking Flame (1989), two re-creations of the poems of Jalal-ud-Din Rumi that have helped to revive popular awareness of the Sufi mystical tradition through the work of this great thirteenth-century mystic and poet. The Way of Passion is adapted from an extraordinary series of lectures Harvey delivered at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco in Spring 1993, presenting Rumi's ecstatic vision of spiritual surrender and union as a guide to the contemporary spiritual and ecological crisis. Harvey emphasizes that we must transform the spiritual barrenness at the heart of modern Western life to change its devastating global consequences. This visionary and vital work transmits the urgency, passion, and intensity of Rumi's message to our times.</p><p><b>Andrew Harvey</b> is an internationally acclaimed poet, novelist, mystical scholar, seeker, and teacher. He is the author of more than thirty books, including <b>Son of Man</b>, <b>The Direct Path</b>, <b>Hidden Journey</b>, <b>The Way of Passion</b>, <b>The Return of the Mother</b>, and <b>A Journey in Ladakh</b>.Harvey is probably best known for Hidden Journey (Viking, 1991), in which he details his spiritual surrender to the Indian mystic Mother Meera. He has since found in the mystic poetry of the 13th-century Sufi master Rumi a distillation of the message that he believes Mother Meera embodies and that the world cannot afford to ignore. "I believe we are all in the last moments of a civilization," Harvey writes. "What is at stake is the whole human experiment." Some will find this fixation on the imminent apocalypse distracting. Taken from a series of lectures given in 1993, the book is probably of greatest interest to those having some prior familiarity with the poetry. Harvey's passion and enthusiasm often lead to hyperbole, and his interpretation of Rumi, while compelling, needs to be absorbed slowly and with a critical eye.

The truth is, dogs are neither--and our misunderstanding has put them in serious crisis. What dogs really need is a spokesperson, someone who will assert their specific needs. Renowned anthrozoologist Dr. John Bradshaw has made a career of studying human-animal interactions, and in Dog Sense he uses the latest scientific research to show how humans can live in harmony with--not just dominion over-- their four-legged friends. From explaining why positive reinforcement is a more effective (and less damaging) way to control dogs&#39; behavior than punishment to demonstrating the importance of weighing a dog&#39;s unique personality against stereotypes about its breed, Bradshaw offers extraordinary insight into the question of how we really ought to treat our dogs.</p><p><b>John Bradshaw</b> is the Waltham Director of the Anthrozoology Institute at the University of Bristol and founder of the Anthrozoology Institute at the University of Southampton.

More specifically, he details their evolution from a wolf-like ancestor into proto-dogs and then the first domesticated species; he also investigates how this very long-term relationship has affected both canines and humans. He goes on to clearly explain how today&#x2019;s dogs differ behaviorally and culturally from wolves, and why the dominance/pack paradigm put forth by many trainers (including Cesar Milan) is not only the wrong way to understand dogs but has also done them a great disservice. It makes for engrossing and thought-provoking reading.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Bradshaw draws upon two decades spent studying canine science to debunk the myths surrounding dog ownership.... [F]or readers with well-loved pets who view their canines as family members, there&#x2019;s much to digest as the author traces the dog&#x2019;s cognitive growth process as he matures from a sensitive pup into adulthood.

Twenty-five years ago a new German state came into being. How much do we really understand this new Germany, and how do its people now understand themselves? Neil MacGregor argues that uniquely for any European country, no coherent, over-arching narrative of Germany&#39;s history can be constructed, for in Germany both geography and history have always been unstable. Its frontiers have constantly floated. K�nigsberg, home to the greatest German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, is now Kaliningrad, Russia; Strasbourg, in whose cathedral Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Germany&#39;s greatest writer, discovered the distinctiveness of his country&#39;s art and history, now lies within the borders of France. For most of the five hundred years covered by this book Germany has been composed of many separate political units, each with a distinct history. And any comfortable national story Germans might have told themselves before 1914 was destroyed by the events of the following thirty years. German history may be inherently fragmented, but it contains a large number of widely shared memories, awarenesses and experiences; examining some of these is the purpose of this book. Beginning with the fifteenth-century invention of modern printing by Gutenberg, MacGregor chooses objects and ideas, people and places which still resonate in the new Germany - porcelain from Dresden and rubble from its ruins, Bauhaus design and the German sausage, the crown of Charlemagne and the gates of Buchenwald - to show us something of its collective imagination. There has never been a book about Germany quite like it.</p><p>Neil MacGregor has been Director of the British Museum since August 2002. He was Director of the National Gallery in London from 1987 to 2002. His celebrated books include A History of the World in 100 Objects, now translated into more than a dozen languages and one of the top-selling titles ever published by Penguin Press, Shakespeare&#39;s Restless World and Germany: Memories of a Nation.A <i>Sunday Times</i> bestseller<br>&#x201c;Fascinating. . . .The book&#x2019;s high-quality allows for its many illustrations to be reproduced well. Engravings, paintings, photographs and detailed maps from Germany&#x2019;s past all serve to make its legacy come alive. Throughout this magnificent work, Neil MacGregor shows that despite its past, Germany is a country that has come into full flower a quarter-century into its fully unified modern state. He presents the healthy perspective of a people who, despite being weighted with baggage, are reconciling well as they move into the future.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2014;Perry Munyon, <i>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Highly readable. . . .beautifully illustrated. . . .Mr. MacGregor&#x2019;s choice of objects is always interesting...and his treatment is lively.&#x201d; &#x2014;Neil Gregor, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;MacGregor [is] our greatest cultural polymath. . . . Anyone who wants to understand Germany should read this book.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;Antony Beevor, <i>The Observer</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Immensely readable and sharply intelligent. . . . MacGregor&#x2019;s chapters move boldly and fluently across time, held together by his own assured by attractively conversational voice. . . . The starting point is often something material, like Riemenschneider&#x2019;s four evangelists, reprising the successful formula of MacGregor&#x2019;s wonderful and much-imitated <i>A History of the World in 100 Objects,</i> a previous cooperative venture between the British Museum and the BBC. The objects considered in the present book include things you would expect: Gutenberg&#x2019;s printing press, Luther&#x2019;s German translation of the Bible, Meissen porcelain, a modernist cradle and ceramic vases from the Bauhaus, the Volkswagen Beetle. Other objects might be more surprising to readers. The coinage of the Holy Roman Empire and the no less impressive diversity of German sausages both serve to illustrate the historic fragmentation of the German lands, a major theme of the book. . . . The book is filled not just with objects, but with places of memory. There is a fine chapter on the forest and its place in the German imagination, which draws on the fairytales of the Brothers Grimm and the work of Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich, and takes the story up to the present day and the new meaning of the forest within a green Germany. MacGregor writes especially well about monuments, such as the Brandenburg Gate and the Victory Column in Berlin. He is adept at showing how monuments bear witness to the constant reworking of German history&#x2014;the work of salvaging, even. . . . MacGregor&#x2019;s light touch means that we never feel as if we are being hurried along to a predetermined destination, not even in the section called &#x201c;The Descent&#x201d; that takes us from Bismarck to Hitler. There is some artful foreshadowing in earlier chapters. . . . MacGregor shows his sill at making objects speak. . . . There are many brilliant vignettes in this book, too many to mention in a review. . . . high-minded, cosmopolitan...beautifully illustrated. MacGregor is an engaging guide who never talks down to readers. He has written a remarkable set of reflections on the objects and places of German memory.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;David Blackbourn, <i>The Guardian</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Four years ago, Neil MacGregor made marvelous use of the British Museum, of which he is the director, to interpret the history of the world through 100 objects. Since the museum owns a fabulous collection of German artefacts&#x2014;including not one, but two of the original Gutenberg bibles&#x2014;it makes sense to apply that same method to a country that, at the end of a year of military strutting, we are beginning to view with more respect. . . . Magnificently illustrated and superbly edited. . . . It&#x2019;s hard to imagine a method more successful than MacGregor&#x2019;s&#x2014;the careful juxtaposition of singular objects with their surrounding history&#x2014;for conveying the complexities of Germany&#x2019;s continuing journey.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;Miranda Seymour, <i>Daily Telegraph</i> (Four Stars)<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Neil MacGregor&#x2019;s alternative cultural history of a country uniquely difficult to pinpoint&#x2014;its borders shifting, its ruling systems manifold for much of the past 500 years&#x2014;offers the sense of a coherent whole nonetheless. His method is memory. His way in is through objects and people; places and buildings; paintings, toys, and printed money; forests and single oak trees. . . . MacGregor knows unerringly which objects to select and which chapters of Germany&#x2019;s &#x201c;enrichingly and confusingly fragmented history&#x201d; to bring to life through them. . . . This book is immaculately researched, timely and important.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;Rebecca K. Morrison, <i>The Independent</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The director of the British Museum tells the compelling story of a traumatized country through objects and places that represent the enduring strength and hope of the people. . . . MacGregor traces the evolution of German identity. . . . A comprehensive record jam-packed with visuals.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;<i>Kirkus<br></i><br>&#x201c;Through artifacts as varied as a sausage, Gutenberg Bibles, and a porcelain rhinoceros, MacGregor illustrates how a composite German identity was forged and the country came to be. . . . His concise lessons in German history form a cogent and fluent account that gets as close to the core of German identity as any book by a non-German could.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly </i>(Starred)<br>&#x201c;Striking. . . . <i>Germany: Memories of a Nation</i> is deeply felt, carefully conceived, and an important addition to any consideration of the shape not only of modern Germany but of Europe as a whole.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;<i>The Economist</i></p><h2>There&#39;s Something in a Sunday</h2><p>Private eye Sharon McCone takes on a routine surveillance as a favor to a long-time client of her employer, the All-Souls Law Co-operative. Soon, however, the routine case turns into a murder investigation and leads to San Francisco&#39;s upper-class social activists.</p><p>Muller's ( Eye of the Storm ) virtuosity is demonstrated again in her eighth Sharon McCone mystery. Though the single, 35-ish investigator for San Francisco's All Souls Law Cooperative suspects her client, custom shirtmaker Rudy Goldring, isn't being completely candid with her, she agrees to tail Frank Wilkonson, the manager of the Burning Oak Ranch, whose activities, Sharon learns, are confined to places and events connected with the horticulture world. At Goldring's apartment to deliver her report, she encounters a frantic woman fleeing the premises and the clothier's corpse. Searching for clues, Sharon finds a leather pouch belonging to a derelict Goldring has befriended, and the homeless man becomes the main suspect in the murder. Believing in his innocence, the sleuth turns her attention to Wilkonson and to locating the unidentified woman while coping with upheaval in her co-workers' personal lives. Sharon is a rarity in the genre: a multidimensional protagonist, who, with every book, grows as a person. This is a provocative work, infused with compassion and sensitivity, that explores the complexities of human relationships and the plight of the homeless. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Hobbit, a Wardrobe, and a Great War: How J.

Tolkien and C. S. Lewis</em></strong></p><p>The First World War laid waste to a continent and permanently altered the political and religious landscape of the West. For a generation of men and women, it brought the end of innocence&#x2014;and the end of faith. Yet for J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, the Great War deepened their spiritual quest. Both men served as soldiers on the Western Front, survived the trenches, and used the experience of that conflict to ignite their Christian imagination. Had there been no Great War, there would have been no<em>Hobbit</em>, no&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>, no&nbsp;<em>Narnia</em>, and perhaps no conversion to Christianity by C. S. Lewis.</p><p>Unlike a generation of young writers who lost faith in the God of the Bible, Tolkien and Lewis produced epic stories infused with the themes of guilt and grace, sorrow and consolation. Giving an unabashedly Christian vision of hope in a world tortured by doubt and disillusionment, the two writers created works that changed the course of literature and shaped the faith of millions. This is the first book to explore their work in light of the spiritual crisis sparked by the conflict.</p></p><p><p>Joseph Loconte is a Senior Research Fellow and Lecturer in Politics at The King's College in New York City, where he teaches Western Civilization and U.S. foreign policy and writes widely about the importance of religious freedom in strengthening democracy, human rights, and civil society.</p> <p> </p></p><h2>Ice (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><p><i>Ice</i> is at the center of Vladimir Sorokin's epic&nbsp;<i>Ice Trilogy, </i>which is also published by NYRB Classics.<br><br>Moscow has been hit by a wave of brutal murders.

A gritty dispatch from the front lines of the contemporary world, a gnostic fairy tale, a hard-boiled parable, a New Age parody, a bitingly funny fantasy in the great Russian tradition that begins with Gogol and continues with Nabokov, a renegade fiction to set beside those of Philip K. Dick and Michel Houellebecq, and the most ambitious and accomplished novel yet by Vladimir Sorokin, the stylistic virtuoso and master of provocation who, in the words of <i>The Moscow Times</i>, is &#x201c;the only living Russian author who can be called a classic.&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>VLADIMIR SOROKIN </b>was born in Moscow. He trained as an engineer, but turned to writing novels, plays, short stories, and screenplays. In 1992, his <i>Collected Stories</i> was nominated for a Russian Booker Prize. He was presented with the 2001 Andrey Biely Award for outstanding contributions to Russian literature, and in 2002, he wrote a libretto for an opera for the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Sorokin is a member of the Russian Pen Club and his books have been translated into numerous languages. He lives in Moscow with his wife and twin daughters."Considered [Sorokin's] fineset work to date." --<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"The controversial postmodernist Vladimir Sorokin has struck through the language barrier again in a crystalline English translation by Jamey Gambrell of his unnerving novel...<i>Ice</i>, one of 11 novels he has written, and the first installment in a projected trilogy to be published by New York Review Books, is a marvelous introduction to his work." &#x2014;<i>The St. Petersburg Times</i> [Russia]<br><br>"George A.

Sorokin &#x2013; who was once threatened with jail for writing a sex scene between Khrushchev and Stalin &#x2013; has written a story about an asteroid buried in Siberia that communicates with its alien but humanoid &#x201c;children.&#x201d; Convinced of their superiority, the aliens regard humans as &#x201c;meat machines&#x201d; and dispatch them remorselessly. Yet Sorokin makes us feel a disturbing sympathy for the murderous aliens. In the process, he explores the dark secret of lockstep, exclusivist zealotry: Once you&#x2019;ve joined the in-crowd, you zealotry: Once you&#x2019;ve joined the in-crowd, you really do feel like a member of a superior species.<br>Those who aren&#x2019;t with you are worse than inferior &#x2013; they&#x2019;re disposable. Of course, you could ignore the ah-ha insight and read <i>Ice </i>for its surprising plot twists and insider&#x2019;s view of secret cults &#x2013; that is, the kind of thriller elements that are irresistible to U.S. meat machines.&#x201d; &#x2013;Very Short List<br><br>&#x201c;<i>ICE</i> is the rare novel that tiptoes between the fictional world and the reader&#x2019;s, as answers arising from the gloom succumb to yet another unforeseen question. In <i>ICE</i>, no one is safe from Sorokin&#x2019;s brilliantly chilling pen&#x2013;no character, and certainly no reader.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Paste Magazine</i><br><br>"A truly thrilling postmodern thriller...Ice succeeds brilliantly as both a thriller and a cautionary tale about totalitarianism, bigotry, elitism, and fundamentalism.

The &#x2018;empties&#x2019; (those whose hearts are silent) are left to die; the others (whose hearts spontaneously utter a word or two in the 23-word &#x2018;heart language&#x2019;) are recognized by their assailants as fellow &#x2018;heart speakers&#x2019;&#x2013;a Lapin, Nikolaeva and Borenboim&#x2013;are instructed by Khram, the mentor of Russia&#x2019;s heart speakers, in the tenets of their new life, in which they love one another and hammer humans to achieve the apocalypse. Khram herself was &#x2018;hammered&#x2019; by a German S.S. officer in a WWII slave labor camp, and in a long flashback, she returns to Stalin&#x2019;s Russia to secure the Siberian ice needed for hammering and to exploit the gulag for heart speakers through mass murder. In stripped down, poker-faced prose, Sorokin registers a world in which the inhumanity of man to man is exploited by a murderous emerging race who are, by contrast, in sweet mutual harmony with one another.

In all his major works he seems to be asking the reader: dare you read on?&#x201d;&#x2013;<i>The Literary Encyclopedia</i><br><br>&#x201c;Vladimir Sorokin...is in his mid-forties, and has a broad face, soft eyes, and a chin that ends in a soul patch. He is not a small man, and, dressed in a T-shirt and beach shorts, he lumbers around like the kind of peaceful, intelligent animal that could grace Canadian currency. He admires the English writer J.G. Ballard. And has the habit of phrasing his statements in the form of a question by adding an interrogative &#x2018;yes&#x2019; at the end. &#x2018;Literature is a text, yes?&#x2019;...Yet Sorokin was cautiously optimistic about the future. &#x2018;There has been a literary renaissance in the past few years,&#x2019; he told me, and then proposed his theory of Russian Literature, which I warn you, involves a bear metaphor: &#x2018;The Russian bear is big and mostly asleep. He awakes only during revolution, wars, perestroika, and so on, then he goes back to sleep. When he wakes up, he doesn&#x2019;t need literature, and there have been no good novels written in these times.

You knew what Charles was when you married him and when you took him as your mate.&#x201d;</p><p>He was trying to make this about her, because then he wouldn&#x2019;t have to listen to her. He couldn&#x2019;t be that blind, just too stubborn. So his attempt to alter the argument&#x2014;when there should be no argument at all&#x2014;enraged her.</p><p>&#x201c;Someone in here is acting like a child, and it isn&#x2019;t me,&#x201d; she growled right back at him.</p><p>Bran&#x2019;s return snarl was wordless.</p><p>&#x201c;Anna, shut up,&#x201d; Tag whispered urgently, his big body limp on the floor where his orange dreadlocks clashed with the maroon of the Persian rug. He was her friend and she trusted the berserker&#x2019;s judgment on most things. Under other circumstances she&#x2019;d have listened to him, but right now she had Bran so angry he couldn&#x2019;t speak&#x2014;so she could get a few words in past his stubborn, inflexible mind.</p><p>&#x201c;I know my mate,&#x201d; she told her father by marriage. &#x201c;Better than you do. He will break before he disappoints you or fails to do his duty. You have to stop this because he can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>When Bran spoke, his voice was a toneless whisper. &#x201c;My son will not bend or break. He has done his job for a century before you were even born, and he&#x2019;ll be doing it a century from now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His job was to dispense justice,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Even if it meant killing people, he could do it. Now he is merely an assassin. His prey cling to his feet repentant and redeemable. They weep and beg for mercy that he can&#x2019;t give. It is breaking him,&#x201d; she said starkly. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m the only one who sees it.&#x201d;</p><p>Bran flinched. And for the first time, she realized that Charles wasn&#x2019;t the only one suffering under the new, harsher rules the werewolves had to live by.</p><p>&#x201c;Desperate times,&#x201d; he said grimly, and Anna hoped that she&#x2019;d broken through. But he shook off the momentary softness and said, &#x201c;Charles is stronger than you give him credit for. You are a stupid little girl who doesn&#x2019;t know as much as she thinks she does. Go home before I do something I&#x2019;ll regret later. Please.&#x201d;</p><p>It was that brief break that told her this was useless. He did know. He did understand, and he was hoping against hope that Charles could hold out. Her anger fled and left . . . despair.</p><p>She met her Alpha&#x2019;s eyes for a long moment before acknowledging her failure.</p><p>Anna knew exactly when Charles drove up, newly returned from Minnesota where he&#x2019;d gone to take care of a problem the Minnesota pack leader would not. If she&#x2019;d been deaf to the sound of the truck or the front door, she&#x2019;d have known Charles was home by the magic that tied wolf to mate. That was all the bond told her outright, though&#x2014;his side of their bond was as opaque as he could manage, and that told her a whole lot more about his state of mind than he probably intended.</p><p>From the way he let nothing leak through to her, she knew it had been another bad trip, one that had left too many people dead, probably people he hadn&#x2019;t wanted to kill.</p><p>Lately, they had all been bad trips.</p><p>At first she&#x2019;d been able to help, but when the rules changed, when the werewolves had admitted their existence to the rest of the world, the new public scrutiny meant that second chances for the wolves who broke Bran&#x2019;s laws were offered only in extraordinary circumstances. She&#x2019;d kept going with him on these trips because she refused to let Charles suffer alone. But when Anna started having nightmares about the man who&#x2019;d fallen to his knees in front of her in mute entreaty before his execution, Charles had quit letting her go.</p><p>She was strong&#x2013;willed and she liked to think of herself as tough. She could have made him change his mind or followed him anyway. But Anna hadn&#x2019;t fought his edict because she realized she was only making his job harder to bear. He saw himself as a monster and couldn&#x2019;t believe she didn&#x2019;t also when she witnessed the death he brought.</p><p>So Charles went out hunting alone&#x2014;as he had for a hundred years or more, just as his father had said. His hunt was always successful&#x2014;and, at the same time, a failure. He was dominant; he had a compulsory need to protect the weak, including, paradoxically, the wolves he was there to kill. When the wolves he executed died, so did a part of Charles.</p><p>Before Bran had brought them out to the public, the new wolves, those who had been Changed for less than ten years, would have been given several chances if their transgression came from loss of control. Conditions could have been taken into account that would lessen the punishment of others. But the public knew about them now, and they couldn&#x2019;t allow everyone to know just how dangerous werewolves really were.</p><p>It was up to the pack Alpha to take care of dispensing commonplace justice. Previously, Charles had only had to go out a few times a year to take care of bigger or more unusual problems. But many of the Alphas were unhappy with the new harshness of the laws, and somehow more and more of the enforcement fell to Bran and thus to Charles. He was going out two or three times a month and it was wearing on him.</p><p>She could feel him standing just inside the house, so she put a little more passion into her music, calling him to her with the sweet&#x2013;voiced cello that had been his first Christmas gift to her.</p><p>If she went upstairs, he&#x2019;d greet her gravely, tell her he had to go talk to his father and leave. He&#x2019;d come back in a day or so after running as a wolf in the mountains. But Charles never quite came back all the way anymore.</p><p>It had been a month since he&#x2019;d last touched her. Six weeks and four days since he&#x2019;d made love to her, not since they&#x2019;d come back from the last trip she&#x2019;d accompanied him on. She&#x2019;d have said that to Bran if he hadn&#x2019;t made that &#x201c;Grow up, little girl&#x201d; comment. Probably she should have told Bran anyway, but she&#x2019;d given up making him see reason.</p><p>She&#x2019;d decided to try something else.</p><p>She stayed in the music room Charles had built in the basement while he stood upstairs. Instead of words, she let her cello speak for her. Rich and true, the notes slid from her bow and up the stairway. After a moment she heard the stairs squeak a little under the weight of his feet and let out a breath of relief. Music was something they shared.</p><p>Her fingers sang to him, coaxing him to her, but he stopped in the doorway. She could feel his eyes on her, but he didn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p>Anna knew that when playing on her cello, her face was peaceful and distant&#x2014;a product of much coaching from an early teacher who told her that biting her lip and grimacing was a dead giveaway to any judge that she was having trouble. Her features weren&#x2019;t regular enough for true beauty, but she wasn&#x2019;t ugly, either, and today she&#x2019;d used some makeup tricks that softened her freckles and emphasized her eyes.</p><p>She glanced at him briefly. His Salish heritage gave him lovely dark skin and exotic (to her) features, his father&#x2019;s Welsh blood apparent only in subtle ways: the shape of his mouth, the angle of his chin. It was his job, not his lineage, that froze his features into an unemotional mask and left his eyes cold and hard. His duties had eaten away at him until he was nothing but muscle, bone, and tension.</p><p>Anna&#x2019;s fingers touched the strings and rocked, softening the cello&#x2019;s song with a vibrato on the longer notes. She&#x2019;d begun with a bit of Pachelbel&#x2019;s Canon in D, which she generally used as a warm&#x2013;up or when she wasn&#x2019;t sure what she wanted to play. She considered moving to something more challenging, but she was too distracted by Charles. Besides, she wasn&#x2019;t trying to impress him, but to seduce him into letting her help. So, Anna needed a song that she could play while thinking of Charles.</p><p>If she couldn&#x2019;t get Bran to quit sending her mate out to kill, maybe she could get Charles to let her help with the aftermath. It might buy him a little time until she could find the right baseball bat&#x2014;or rolling pin&#x2014;to beat some clarity into his father&#x2019;s head.</p><p>She deserted Pachelbel for an improvised bridge that shifted the key from D to G and then let her music flow into the prelude of Bach&#x2019;s Cello Suite No. 1. Not that that music was easy, but it had been her high school concert piece so she could practically play it in her sleep.</p><p>Her fingers moving, she didn&#x2019;t allow herself to look at him again, no matter how hungry she was for the sight of him. She stared at an oil painting of a sleeping bobcat while Charles stood at the door and watched her. If she could get him to approach her, to quit trying to protect her from his job . . .</p><p>And then she screwed up.</p><p>She was an Omega wolf. That meant that not only was she the only person on the continent whose wolf would allow her to face down the Marrok when he was in a rage, but also that she had a magical talent for soothing wolfish tempers regardless of whether or not they wanted to be soothed. It felt wrong to impose her will on others, and she tried not to do it unless the need was dire. Over the past few years, Anna had learned when and how to best use her ability. But her need to see Charles happy slipped over the barrier of her hard&#x2013;won control as if it wasn&#x2019;t there at all.</p><p>One moment she was playing to him with her whole self, focused solely on him&#x2014;and the next her wolf reached out and calmed Charles&#x2019;s wolf, sent him to sleep, leaving only his human half behind . . . Charles turned and walked purposefully away from her without a word. He, who ran from nothing and no one, exited their house by the back door.</p><p>Anna set down her bow and returned her cello to its stand. He wouldn&#x2019;t come back for hours now, maybe not even for a couple of days. Music hadn&#x2019;t worked if the only thing holding Charles in its spell was his wolf.</p><p>She left the house, too. The need to do something was so strong it had her moving without a real destination. It was that or cry, and she refused to cry. Maybe she could go to Bran one more time. But when the turnoff for his house appeared, she drove past it.</p><p>Like as not Charles was headed to Bran&#x2019;s to tell his father what he&#x2019;d done for the wolves of the world&#x2014;and it would be . . . awkward to follow him, as if she were chasing him. Besides, she&#x2019;d already talked to Bran. He knew what was happening to his son; she knew he did. But, like Charles, he weighed the lives of all of their kind against the possibility that Charles would break under the strain of what was necessary, and thought the risk acceptable.</p><p>So Anna drove through town, arriving at a large greenhouse in the woods on the other side. She pulled over and parked next to a battered Willys Jeep and went in search of help.</p><p>A lot of wolves called him the Moor&#x2014;which he disliked, saying that it was a vampire kind of thing to do, take a part of who a person was and reduce him to it with a capital letter or two. His features and skin showed traces of Arabia by way of North Africa, but Anna agreed that certainly wasn&#x2019;t the sum total of who he was. He was very beautiful, very old, extremely deadly&#x2014;and right now he was transplanting geraniums.</p><p>&#x201c;Asil,&#x201d; she began.</p><p>&#x201c;Hush,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t disturb my plants with your troubles until they are safe in their new houses. Make yourself useful and deadhead the roses along the wall.&#x201d;</p><p>She snagged a basket and started picking dead flowers off Asil&#x2019;s rosebushes. There would be no talking to him until he&#x2019;d accomplished what he intended, whether that was to calm her down before they talked, get some free labor, or merely keep the silence while he tended his plants. Knowing Asil, it could be all three.</p><p>She worked for about ten minutes before she got impatient and reached for a rosebud, knowing that he always kept an eye on anyone working with his precious flowers.</p><p>&#x201c;Remember the story of Beauty and the Beast?&#x201d; remarked Asil gently. &#x201c;Go ahead. Take that little bloom. See what happens.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Beauty and the Beast&#x2019; is a French fairy tale and you are a mere Spaniard,&#x201d; Anna told him, but she took her fingers off the bud. Beauty&#x2019;s father had stolen a flower at great cost. &#x201c;And in no way are you an enchanted prince.&#x201d;</p><p>He dusted off his hands and turned to her, smiling a little. &#x201c;Actually I am. For some definitions of &#x2019;prince.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hah,&#x201d; said Anna. &#x201c;Poor Belle would find herself kissing your handsome face and then, poof, there would be the frog.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think you are mixing your fairy tales,&#x201d; Asil told her. &#x201c;But even as a frog I would not disappoint. You came to talk fairy tales, querida?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; She sighed, hopping up to sit on a convenient flat table next to a bunch of small pots that held a single pea&#x2013;sized leaf each. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to get advice about beasts. Specifically, information about the beast who rules us all. Naturally I sought you out. Bran has to quit sending Charles out to kill. It is destroying him.&#x201d;</p><p>He sat on the table opposite hers and looked at her with the space of the narrow aisle between them. &#x201c;You do know that Charles lived nearly two hundred years without you to take care of him, yes? He is not a fragile rosebud who needs your tender touch to survive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a killer, either,&#x201d; Anna snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;I beg to differ.&#x201d; Asil spread his hands peaceably when she snarled at him. &#x201c;The results speak for themselves. I doubt that there are any othe...</p></p><h2>The Me, Me, Me Epidemic: A Step-by-Step Guide to Raising Capable, Grateful Kids in an Over-Entitled World</h2><p><b>Cure your kids of the entitlement epidemic so they develop happier, more productive attitudes that will carry them into a successful adulthood.</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever Amy McCready mentions the "entitlement epidemic" to a group of parents, she is inevitably met with eye rolls, nodding heads, and loaded comments about affected children. It seems everywhere one looks, there are preschoolers who only behave in the grocery store for a treat, narcissistic teenagers posting selfies across all forms of social media, and adult children living off their parents.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parenting expert McCready reveals in this book that the solution is to help kids develop healthy attitudes in life. By setting up limits with consequences and training them in responsible behavior and decision making, parents can rid their homes of the entitlement epidemic and raise confident, resilient, and successful children. Whether parents are starting from scratch with a young toddler or navigating the teen years, they will find in this book proven strategies to effectively quell entitled attitudes in their children.</p><p><b>Amy McCready</b> is the founder of Positive Parenting Solutions, author of<i> If I Have to Tell You One More Time . . .

We see an imagination capable of turning your great-grandmother&#x2019;s delicate candlestick into a lightsaber to vanquish enemies from the living room. An energy that drags us on a wild-goose chase all over the house and yard looking for a minuscule ballet slipper charm. And a determination that pesters us for days to let them attend an out-of-state concert, and pay for it, too. And yet, beyond the chaos, the griping and the power struggles, we see potential. And that&#x2019;s why I wrote this book. I know that inside each of our precious children is the potential for something amazing: a confident adult who has the drive and ability to make her corner of the planet a better place.</p><p>You&#x2019;re reading this book&#x2014;and I wrote it&#x2014;because there&#x2019;s a force that can rob from our kids not only their imagination, energy and determination, but also their ability to live rich, fulfilling lives. It&#x2019;s the force of <i>entitlement</i>, the idea that life <i>owes</i> us something, and it&#x2019;s wreaking havoc on our kids&#x2019; generation. Children of all ages feel entitled to receive the best of what life has to offer without working for it, to have their whims catered to by their parents and a path paved for success. They believe the world revolves around them&#x2014;who wouldn&#x2019;t, when everywhere you turn you see a selfie? Over-entitled kids become over-entitled adults with the same childish attitudes, only on a greater scale. It&#x2019;s a big problem, because kids who feel entitled to call the shots all the time are unable to handle it when things don&#x2019;t go their way (like in the real world). What&#x2019;s more, they&#x2019;re just plain hard to live with!</p><p>But entitlement is not the end of your kids&#x2019; story. Imagine a home in which kids take responsibility, contribute to the family, work hard, give back, manage their own finances and feel grateful for what they have. These kids are happy and confident and will be well prepared for whatever adulthood has in store. This is the potential you see in your children&#x2014;and this can be their future.</p><p>Whether you&#x2019;re in the trenches of the entitlement epidemic, with kids who will barely lift their feet so you can vacuum under them, or trying to ward it off to begin with, I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re reading this book. I&#x2019;ve waded through the entitlement trenches with my own two sons and I know firsthand the challenges we parents face. And along the way, I&#x2019;ve compiled thirty-five proven tools that <i>really work </i>to stop the entitlement train in its tracks. Your family can put an end to entitlement, too, no matter how many treats it currently takes for your kids to get through the store without pitching a fit. You can make a very real difference in a matter of days by applying even just a few of the tools and strategies you&#x2019;ll find in these pages.</p><p>The Un-Entitler Toolbox strategies throughout this book will give you the confidence, know-how and even the words to say as you rid your home of the entitled behaviors that are not only driving you nuts but also giving you cause for concern about your offspring&#x2019;s future. Misbehaviors and entitled attitudes (&#x201c;I can have what I want when I want it!&#x201d;) will melt away, as kids of all ages learn to pitch in around the house, solve their disagreements respectfully, take responsibility for their actions and even put down their smartphones once in a while. This dream is within your reach, and your kids will be better off for it.</p><p>The tools you use will bring out your kids&#x2019; very best behavior (no more chore wars, homework battles and sassy attitudes) and help them develop the responsibility, resilience and respectfulness they need for a successful adult life. You&#x2019;ll do it all while you extinguish the entitlement epidemic and make your home a haven of peace in a world of entitled attitudes.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s un-entitle our kids. Help them imagine new worlds (without expecting a team of workers to come in and build it for them), take on their own responsibility (without needing their hand held every step of the way) and put that determination to use serving others rather than expecting to be served. Then, and only then, will our kids unlock their potential to become their very best&#x2014;without feeling entitled to it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>It&#x2019;s the evening before Natasha&#x2019;s high school graduation&#x2014;and Natasha couldn&#x2019;t be more miserable. She&#x2019;s in her bedroom, crying tears of raw emotion over the fact that she&#x2019;s out of her favorite hair gel. Her mother is too busy writing Natasha&#x2019;s name in icing on six dozen cupcakes for her graduation party to rush out to the store tonight to get more. Her mom should have decorated them earlier! Still leaking tears, Natasha reenters the kitchen to let her mom know that she just <i>has</i> to have that special hair gel or her hair will be a huge frizzy mess and she&#x2019;ll look like a total dork on her big day. After a few lame suggestions, her mom leaves the cupcakes and goes upstairs to try to squeeze out one last palmful of her own drugstore-brand styling gel and then puts away the mess of cosmetics Natasha has left out on the counter.</p><p>Natasha wanders off and texts her boyfriend to pick her up, but he&#x2019;s busy with his friends. The jerk. He just saw his friends yesterday. Maybe she&#x2019;ll threaten to dump him again&#x2014;that&#x2019;ll make him shape up. Sometimes she wonders why she even has a boyfriend. She finds her dad and remembers that she needs to ask him for extra money so she can buy a couple of new swimsuits and sandals for the season. He sees the evidence of her tears and forks over the cash. It&#x2019;s not as much as she wanted, though, so he promises to put the rest on his credit card, which has been busy lately thanks to another recent purchase: a brand-new car as Natasha&#x2019;s graduation present. It&#x2019;s supposed to be a secret, but Natasha overheard her dad on the phone with the dealer earlier in the day. &#x201c;It had better be a convertible,&#x201d; she thinks.</p><p>Of course, Natasha is proud to be graduating tomorrow. After all, she managed to stay awake in most of her classes, thanks to her smartphone. Her homework took a lot of effort, but the tutor her parents hired for her was able to complete it just fine. Soon Natasha will be out in the real world, and when she wasn&#x2019;t pitching a fit over having to empty the dishwasher <i>and</i> watch her little brother in the same afternoon, and for only $20, she was excited. Finally, she&#x2019;d be an adult&#x2014;able to party every night, not just Thursday through Saturday. Her parents have talked to her about enrolling in the community college and getting a job, but Natasha thinks a gap year is a good idea and no one is hiring where she wants to work. She actually inquired at both places&#x2014;a clothing store and a makeup store&#x2014;but her parents aren&#x2019;t getting off her back. Natasha knows they&#x2019;ll cool it in a week or two; it&#x2019;s just this business about graduation that&#x2019;s getting them all riled up.</p><p>Natasha sighs. If she can&#x2019;t have her hair gel tonight, maybe she should work on her mom about letting her spend next weekend at Amber&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; beach house. <i>All</i> her friends are going, and it wouldn&#x2019;t be fair for Natasha not to go, too. Besides, Natasha is eighteen and done with school&#x2014;it&#x2019;s time for her to call the shots in her own life. And what a life it will be! If she could just get her boyfriend to pay attention to her, her parents to give her what she wants and a convertible, she&#x2019;ll finally be happy. Look out world, here comes Natasha.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Look out world indeed. Natasha, in case you couldn&#x2019;t guess, is a classic example of an entitled child. She lacks the ability to look beyond herself, delay gratification or work hard to achieve a goal. Nobody likes to see this in a child of any age, and it can be heartbreaking for parents when they realize their child is floundering when it&#x2019;s time to leave the nest. And while Natasha probably doesn&#x2019;t live at your house, some of this tale of the over-entitled may ring a little truer than you&#x2019;d like. If so, you&#x2019;re in good company. Most first-world parents struggle with some kind of entitlement issues among their kids.</p><p>While we might feel jealous of the kids who actually do get new cars for graduation&#x2014;and a free ride in other areas of life, too&#x2014;we can also feel sorry for them. If the free-car lifestyle pervades their schooling, work, relationships and leisure time, chances are they&#x2019;ve rarely felt the thrill of accomplishment after giving it their best effort, the gratitude of a friend who received their much-needed help for nothing in return, the gratification of finally getting something they&#x2019;ve been working or waiting for or the contentment that comes from being happy in the moment. Entitlement does more than drive parents crazy. It also robs kids of the ability to realize the best of what life has for them, while they instead chase impossible dreams.</p><p>Entitlement is certainly a big problem. In fact, it&#x2019;s epidemic.</p><p>The Entitlement Epidemic</p><p>You couldn&#x2019;t afford your own makeup this month because thirteen-year-old Johnny&#x2019;s fluorescent orange must-have sneakers cost your entire discretionary budget. You keep a spare McDonald&#x2019;s bag on hand so you can pretend to three-year-old Emma that her peanut-butter sandwich was made under the golden arches. And in order to get eight-year-old Daryl into bed, you have to let him fall asleep in front of the television, and carry him there.</p><p>Since when do parents jump through hoops at all costs to keep children happy? Since when do kids get to call the shots? The truth is kids everywhere&#x2014;from toddlers to teens&#x2014;are ruling the roost, and they&#x2019;re not about to abandon their posts without a fight.</p><p>Entitlement happens in every family&#x2014;including mine. Every one of us feels entitled to something on some level&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s a stuffed animal we&#x2019;ve slept with since birth, our smartphone or simply a good night&#x2019;s sleep. These entitlements are all good things, and we might not be able to imagine life without them. If we think about them, we&#x2019;re grateful for them&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s no question there are some things we take for granted. And our kids do, too.</p><p>Entitlement isn&#x2019;t really a disease, but it has hit epidemic levels in our society. And it&#x2019;s certainly not only rich kids who are afflicted. The entitlement problem spans classes and cultures. It&#x2019;s also not only about stuff. Entitled kids believe the world revolves around them.

Here are a few clues you might have an entitlement problem in your home:</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;You find yourself exasperated at your children&#x2019;s demands but caving anyway.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;You&#x2019;re exhausted keeping up with the house, but everyone&#x2019;s too busy watching TV to help.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;You can&#x2019;t make it through the grocery store without buying a treat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;You&#x2019;re frequently supplementing your kids&#x2019; allowance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;You take responsibility for your kids by doing things for them that you know they should be able to do for themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;You resort to bribes or rewards to get cooperation from your kids.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;You frequently rescue your kids by driving forgotten items to school or reminding them about their deadlines.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Your child frequently takes issue with rules and expectations at school or in activities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Your child is quick to blame others for anything that goes wrong.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Your child tries to manipulate others to get his way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Your child commonly sulks or pitches a fit when she doesn&#x2019;t get her way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Your child often complains of being bored and wants to be entertained by you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Your child finds it really difficult to wait patiently for something he wants.<br><p>Sound like a child you know? In truth, there&#x2019;s not a kid alive who doesn&#x2019;t exhibit some of these symptoms from time to time. Whether you&#x2019;ve got a big entitlement outbreak at your house or only a minor case, you&#x2019;ll soon be able to move your kids toward greater independence, responsibility and contentment.</p><p>So What&#x2019;s the Big Deal?</p><p>Leon F. Seltzer, PhD, in an article for <i>Psychology Today</i>,* had this to say about entitlement: &#x201c;Those &#x2018;afflicted&#x2019; with a sense of entitlement demonstrate the attitude that whatever they want, they deserve&#x2014;and automatically at that, simply because they are who they are. So anything they desire, whether material or relational, should be theirs. It&#x2019;s <i>inherently</i> justified; there&#x2019;s no need actually to <i>earn</i> it.&#x201d; We all want what we want&#x2014;and we want to have it <i>now,</i> please. In our culture of plenty, immediate gratification is very much a reality. We can make our dreams come true on multiple levels. But are we better off for it?</p><p>Dr. Seltzer says we&#x2019;re not. Over-entitled people miss out on some of the best that life has to offer. When they&#x2019;re not used to persevering through multiple frustrations, they won&#x2019;t know the pride that comes from achieving hard-won, worthwhile goals. When they expect raises and other rewards simply because they want them and not because they&#x2019;ve earned them, they&#x2019;re set up for frequent disappointment. When they attempt to make others bend to their will because they expect to be served, their relationships will wither. And when all of these combine, we have created a person who will have trouble holding down a steady job, cultivating long-term relationships and completing any task worth completing. Because over-entitled people feel as though the world owes them the best it has to offer, they will completely miss out on just that.</p><p>But entitlement doesn&#x2019;t happen out of the blue. The problem begins when entitlement becomes a way of life for children. In these cases, kids rule the roost. Mom and Dad rush around trying to meet endless demands, whether that means making meat loaf three different ways to cater to discriminating appetites, rushing to the store because the six-year-old is out of her favorite toothpaste or shelling out hundreds of dollars so the fourteen-year-old can look like a minirockstar. While parents attempt to give their kids every advantage in life, kids learn that they shouldn&#x2019;t have to do anything they don&#x2019;t want to, they can have everything that catches their eye and they can quit whenever they want. It ends up that no one&#x2019;s happy&#x2014;parents are run ragged, while kids constantly find they need <i>more, more, more</i>! And benevolent rulers kids are not. They quickly learn to resort to whining, demanding and downright bullying to get what they want.</p><p>Entitlement doesn&#x2019;t just plague our homes: it affects kids&#x2019; schoolwork, activities and friendships, too. Youngsters expect that their C effort will get A grades or that just showing up to practice will get them a starting spot on the basketball team. Friendships are self-centered, as entitled kids lack the ability to empathize and sacrifice. When problems arise, in school and beyond, anything from the wea...</p></p><h2>Reading Wonders, Grade 1, Vol. 2, Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Wonders: Master of Common Core State Standards, Grade 1, Unit 2</p><p></p><h2>Trigun Maximum Volume 4: Bottom of the Dark</h2><p>Vash the Stampede is back for more intense action, and it looks like it&#39;s only going to get harder as the saga continues!

Not only have his works been danced by the New York City Ballet continuously since 1948, but they also have been performed by more than two dozen other companies throughout the world. In clear and elegant writing, Terry Teachout brings to life the dramatic story of George Balanchine, a Russian �migr� who fell in love with American culture, married four times and kept a mistress on the side, and transformed the art of ballet forever.<br><br></p><p>Terry Teachout writes about literature and the arts for the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Baltimore Sun, the National Review, and the Washington Post. He is the author of The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken and The Terry Teachout Reader. He lives in New York City.<br>In 1987 I went to Lincoln Center to watch New York City Ballet dance Concerto Barocco, a ballet by George Balanchine set to Bach's Two-Violin Concerto. I knew the music well, having played one of the solo parts in high school, but except for an isolated Nutcracker seen on a college trip to New York, Barocco (as dancers and regular balletgoers call it) was my first Balanchine ballet. Indeed, I hadn't seen very many ballets of any kind, nor was I much impressed with the ones I had seen. So far as I could tell, they consisted for the most part of thin women in white skirts pretending to be birds, fluttering through elaborately costumed pantomime shows whose quaint plots were too silly to take seriously. I didn't know a lot about Balanchine, but I'd just seen a TV documentary about him that led me to believe that his dances were different, so I decided to give Concerto Barocco a try, in much the same spirit of adventure that might have led another person to go to the Museum of Modern Art, or to a jazz club.<br><br> The New York State Theater, New York City Ballet's headquarters since 1964, doesn't exactly inspire aesthetic confidence, at least not at first glance. A vast shoe box of glass and dirty travertine marble designed by Philip Johnson, it is squat on the outside and strange on the inside. The public areas are full of undistinguished modern sculptures. A monstrous spherical chandelier dangles threateningly from the gold-plated ceiling. The proscenium arch is topped with an ornament that looks like the leatherette dashboard of an early sixties midprice sedan, while the five horseshoe-shaped rings that overlook the orchestra seats are faced with circular lamps that bear a distinct resemblance to the headlights of the same sort of car. The balconies are too high, the auditorium too deep, and unless you're lucky enough to be sitting in the first fifteen rows of the orchestra, you feel as though the stage is a mile or two away. It's not at all the sort of place where one might go expecting a revelation-though that was what lay in store for me.<br><br> At five minutes past eight, the houselights went down and the curtain flew up, revealing eight young women dressed in simple white ballet skirts, standing in front of a blue backdrop. The scrappy little band in the pit slouched to attention, the conductor gave the downbeat, and the women started to move, now in time to Bach's driving beat, now cutting against its grain. As the solo violinists made their separate entrances, two more women came running out from the wings and began to dance at center stage. Their steps were crisp, precise, almost jazzy. For a moment I was confused. The stage was bare, and the dancers' unadorned costumes offered no clue as to who they were or what they were doing, though I could tell that they weren't "acting," not in any conventional sense. They made no obviously theatrical gestures, exchanged no significant glances, yet I felt sure they were telling some kind of story. Was I missing the point? All at once I understood: the music was the story. The dancers were mirroring its complex events, not in a singsongy, naively imitative way but with sophistication and grace. This was no dumb show, no mere pantomime, but sound made visible, written in the air like fireworks glittering in the night sky. When it was over, eighteen breathless minutes later, the audience broke into friendly but routine applause, seemingly unaware that it had witnessed a miracle. Rooted in my seat, eyes wide with astonishment, I asked myself, Why hasn't anybody ever told me about this? And what kind of man made it?<br><br> I have heard similar words-sometimes the very same ones-from almost everyone I've taken to see New York City Ballet since then. Rarely do Balanchine's ballets fail to amaze a first-time viewer. The only difference is that while I already had a vague idea of who George Balanchine was in 1987, most of the people who now accompany me to the ballet do not. <br><br> Within the tight little world of dance, of course, he is a titan. For all intents and purposes, the history of modern ballet starts with his Apollo (1928, music by Stravinsky) and Prodigal Son (1929, music by Prokofiev), and New York City Ballet, the company he founded, has performed his work continuously from 1948 on. But what of the larger world of art and culture? New York City Ballet no longer gets written about much in the national press, nor does it appear on television. I know few art-conscious Manhattanites who go to its performances more than sporadically-or to any other dance performances, for that matter. Nowadays there are no "hot tickets" in dance, no events that attract the attention of a truly general audience, and few at which artists from other fields are likely to be seen. For the most part, ballet and modern dance have retreated to the periphery of American cultural consciousness, just as dance criticism has all but vanished from the pages of American magazines; you don't have to know who Balanchine was, or what he did, in order to be deemed culturally literate. Most of my acquaintances regard my love of dance as a harmless idiosyncrasy, and when I assure them that Balanchine was every bit as important as, say, Matisse, they look at me as though I'd tried to tell them that Raymond Chandler was as important as Proust.<br><br> During Balanchine's lifetime, though, such comparisons were commonplace (though they were more often made with Picasso, an artist with whom he had far less in common). Back then it didn't seem odd for Arlene Croce to declare in the pages of the New Yorker that "if George Balanchine were a novelist or a playwright or a movie director instead of a choreographer, his studies of women would be among the most discussed and most influential artistic achievements of our time." For now that dance is largely ignored by the media, it's easy to forget that there was a time when "everyone" in New York went to New York City Ballet-and not just the beau monde, either, but poets, painters, playwrights, composers, even intellectuals, all of whom went because they knew Balanchine to be a genius at the peak of his powers. In his review of the premiere of Agon (1957, music by Stravinsky), the great dance critic Edwin Denby mentioned in passing that "Marcel Duchamp, the painter, said he felt the way he had after the opening of Le Sacre." One need not admire Duchamp to admit the force of his comparison to the epochal premiere of The Rite of Spring, the 1913 ballet score by Igor Stravinsky that opened the door to musical modernism, or of the fact that so pivotal a figure in the history of art took the trouble to be present on both occasions.<br><br> Nor was Balanchine known only to the illuminati. In 1954 he choreographed Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker for New York City Ballet and appeared on the cover of Time. From then until his death in 1983, and especially after his company took up residence at Lincoln Center, he was one of the best-known artists in America. To be sure, his was far from the biggest name in dance, for those were the days of the "dance boom," the dizzy quarter-century-long interlude when Edward Villella danced on the Ed Sullivan Show, Jerome Robbins ruled Broadway, and the defections of Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov were front-page news everywhere. Still, a star he most definitely was, not least because of his many collaborations with the legendary composer of The Rite of Spring. Balanchine and Stravinsky had worked together as far back as Apollo, and in 1972, the year after Stravinsky's death, New York City Ballet put on a weeklong Stravinsky Festival at which twenty new ballets were presented, among them Duo Concertant, Stravinsky Violin Concerto, and Symphony in Three Movements, three of Balanchine's supreme achievements. And the choreographer was not considered a mere theatrical valet to his older colleague, either. In most of what was written and said about the two men between 1948 and 1983, it was taken for granted that they were peers, and more than enough tastemakers had seen Balanchine's work to make the assumption stick.<br>Copyright � 2004 by Terry Teachout<br><br>All rights reserved.

The world she creates is rich in fantasy, coupled with echoes of a historical saga, all vividly rendered on the page. Tyrannical leaders and a building rebellion set the stage for dual narrators, Elias, one of the elite, trained from a young age to become a skilled assassin for the Commandant at Blackcliff Military Academy, and Laia, one of the oppressed, forced into the role of spy and saboteur in order to save her only remaining family member. Though diametrically opposed within their society, both Laia and Elias are wracked by internal conflict and driven to great lengths by shame and a desire to escape the bonds of their present lives. A complex relationship between them ensues, and while there is a romantic thread to the story, it is ancillary to the larger forces of political power, crippling deceit, and an undistinguished hope that endures in even the darkest corners of their brutal world. Potent action and liquid language whisk the chapters along all too quickly and while this has not been released as part of a series (yet), there can only be great things in store for author Sabaa Tahir, her Martial Empire, and her readers. <em>-- Seira Wilson</em></p>Sabaa Tahir grew up in California&#39;s Mojave Desert at her family&#39;s eighteen-room motel.

After a year in the London &#39;underground&#39; when they experimented with revolutionary techniques like lights which matched their music, they released their first single in 1966. Their breakthrough album, THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, was released in 1973 and stayed in the charts until 1982, the longest a record has ever been continuously in the charts, becoming one of the best-selling all-time albums. In 1975 they released WISH YOU WERE HERE which reached iconic status. THE WALL in 1979 went to number 1 in almost every country in the world. The movie version of THE WALL staring Bob Geldof was released in 1982 becoming a cult favorite. In the 1980s a rift developed between the band members which culminated in law suits. Only recently have there been reconciliations which have allowed founder member Nick Mason to write the definitive history of the band.</p><p>Nick Mason was a founder member of Pink Floyd as drummer/percussionist. He is the only member of the band to survive from its foundation and has played on every Pink Floyd album. He has produced music for TV commercials and played and produced several albums for other bands. His solo album NICK MASON&#39;S FICTICIOUS SPORTS was released in 1981. His other passion is motor cars and he has taken part in the Le Mans 24-hour race. For years he has accumulated images and memorabilia associated with the band with a view to writing their definitive history.The landmark British psychedelic band Pink Floyd's founding drummer limns the group, named after two early bluesmen, in a profusely illustrated coffee-table tome. The band's spacey arrangements, instrumentation, and light shows made it famous; the drug-burnout fate of original leader Syd Barrett, who was later institutionalized, helped, too. As Barrett's legend grew, his former colleagues moved the band closer to the rock mainstream and scored massive hits with such albums as <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> and <i>The Wall</i>. Mason tracks the outfit's progress from the members' meeting in art school a la the Who, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, and other revered British rockers. He details the band's journey from jazzy R &amp; B to the psychedelic explorations that eventually dominated its output. Given Pink Floyd's erstwhile association with mood-altering substances, the more recent story of band members' children's covert strategy to score at a concert is particularly piquant. Incisive, and freighted with pictures, this is a lush treat for the band's considerable fandom. <i>Mike Tribby</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

R. R. Tolkien&#39;s Lord of the Rings is remarkable, it&#39;s certainly no mystery. In a culture where truth is relative and morality is viewed as &#34;old-fashioned,&#34; we eagerly welcome the message of these tales: we have free will, our choices matter, and truth can be known. Matthew Dickerson investigates the importance of free will and moral choices in Tolkien&#39;s Middle Earth, where moral victory, rather than military success, is the &#34;real&#34; story. He explores Christian themes throughout, including salvation, grace, and judgment. Following Gandalf will delight veteran Tolkien fans and offer new fans an impressive introduction to his major works. Engaging and theologically thought-provoking, it will interest pastors, students, seminarians, and layreaders.</p><p>Matthew Dickerson is a computer science professor at Middlebury College. He is the author of The Finnsburg Encounter and Hammers and Nails. He lives with his wife and children in Bristol, Vermont.Dickerson, a teacher at Middlebury College in Vermont and devoted student of Tolkien, begins his work with a strong thematic link to the very popular The Lord of the Rings movies: epic battles. Against the criticism that The Lord of the Rings glorifies war, he argues cogently that Tolkien's original written treatment of these battles provides a very different picture than the films or spin-off video games. He demonstrates how Tolkien offers a deeply nuanced understanding of the nature of war, and how the trilogy criticizes self-aggrandizing glory in battle. As Dickerson moves into the more central, philosophical themes of the books-free will, moral responsibility and ethical absolutes-readers may lose interest, especially when he punctuates discussion of very basic concepts with obscure references from Tolkien's Silmarillion, a work that few will have read: "In contrast to subjective morality, or moral relativism, objective morality is independent of the individual subject.... Feanor's evil deeds, for example, especially the tragic Kinslaying at Alqualonde, are going to be judged." Dickerson's exploration of the nature of the ring's evil power and his final conclusions about the pervasive theological structure behind these stories are engaging, but the verbosity and academic trivia of other sections may alienate some readers. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love</h2><p>Originally released twenty years ago, Love and Limerence has become a classic in the psychology of emotion.

A wholesome diet not only helps to maintain health, but can also play a vital role in recovery from disease. On the other hand, it is an indisputable fact that unhealthy dietary patterns are a primary contributing factor in most disease conditions.<br><br>Our understanding of how and why certain foods can significantly help to improve health, while other foods can accelerate the disease process, grows each year as scientists continue their quest to uncover Nature&#x2019;s secrets. One of the most exciting nutritional discoveries concerns the effects that different foods have on the body&#x2019;s pH levels once they are consumed. Simply put, some foods, once they are metabolized, create an acidic effect within the body, while others act as alkalizing agents that can neutralize harmful acids. To be healthy, it is necessary to be in a state of acid-alkaline (acid-base) balance. Humans have, in fact, a genetically encoded requirement for a dietary balance of acid-forming and alkaline-forming foods. Because of our early ancestors&#x2019; abundant intake of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, we evolved on diets high in organic mineral compounds&#x2015;particularly alkalizing forms of potassium, magnesium, and calcium. We still need these compounds in order to maintain our internal acid-alkaline balance. But, as you will discover, contemporary eating patterns are at odds with our ancient biological machinery, much to the detriment of our health.<br><br>It has been rightly said that both health and disease begin in the cells, for it is at the cellular level that the vast majority of the body&#x2019;s multitude of interactions occur. For example, in order for the body&#x2019;s cells to function properly, they need to receive life-giving nutrients and oxygen from the bloodstream, and at the same time, they need to release cellular wastes. As it turns out, both of these interactions can optimally take place only when the body is in a slightly alkaline state, which allows for an easy flow of oxygen and nutrients into the cell walls and an equally easy disposal of cellular waste. When the body becomes chronically acidic, however, these and many other cellular processes start to become impaired. Eventually, if acidity continues unchecked, the combination of a diminished oxygen and nutrient supply to the cells and the buildup of wastes inside the cells sets into motion both fatigue and disease.<br><br>It&#x2019;s precisely for this reason that both the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association&#x2015;along with the American Medical Association and most other health organizations&#x2015;recommend a minimum of five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Why are fruits and vegetables so important? Because, as suggested above, most fruits and vegetables are high in compounds that help to keep your body in the slightly alkaline state that medical research continues to demonstrate is the ideal internal environment for achieving and maintaining optimal health.<br><br>As you will learn in the chapters ahead, the importance of maintaining proper acid-alkaline balance is not a new concept. In fact, it has been written about in medical textbooks for more than a century. Only in the last few years, however, has the concept of chronic, low-grade acidosis started to make its way to the public at large, primarily through infomercials and select books. Unfortunately, such information is all too often tied into products for which dubious claims are made, or associated with dietary plans that are too restrictive for most people. But, at this same time, a small number of brilliant scientists from around the world have recognized, and are studying, the phenomenon of chronic, low-grade metabolic acidosis. Scientists such as Dr. Lynda Frassetto at the University of California, San Francisco, and Dr. Russell Jaffe of ELISA/ACT Biotechnologies, Inc., have documented that on the whole, the average Western diet is acid-producing, and that it actually creates a low-grade metabolic acidosis in otherwise healthy people. Dozens of such studies have further documented the negative impact that chronic low-grade metabolic acidosis has on health. Osteoporosis, age-related muscle loss, kidney stone formation, gout and other joint diseases, and back pain are among the conditions associated with the move towards an even <em>slightly</em> acidic state. While not life threatening, this low-level acid condition compromises our health.<br><br>Since the original publication of <strong><em>The Acid-Alkaline Food Guide</em></strong>, there has been a surge of interest in the relationship between diet and acid-alkaline balance within both the scientific community and the lay public. While this is an evolving science, in the last few years, research has provided a fuller understanding of how and why acid-alkaline balance is so important for maintaining good health, as well as how eating patterns that disrupt this balance can cause or exacerbate many of the chronic disease conditions that are now so prevalent. (For further information, visit Dr. Brown&#x2019;s websites, www.betterbones.com and www.alkalineforlife.com. Also see the Bibliography, starting on page 185.)<br><br>Today, in the United States and other highly Westernized countries, chronic low-grade acidosis is more the rule than the exception. This is largely due to poor eating and lifestyle habits. We are, in fact, forcing our bodies to labor within a less-than-optimal biochemical environment. The body&#x2019;s adaptation to even mild but chronic metabolic acidosis involves stresses and strains that create a fertile breeding ground for the various forms of chronic illness that are now experienced by more than one out of every three Americans.<br><br>Since your diet dramatically affects acid-alkaline balance either positively or negatively, you might ask yourself how you can change any unhealthy eating habits in a safe and practical manner&#x2015;without having to make drastic changes. <strong><em>The Acid-Alkaline Food Guide</em></strong> was written precisely to answer that question.

Fuzzy brown molds mischievously turn forgotten peaches to slime in the kitchen fruit bowl. And in thousands of other ways, members of the kingdom Fungi do their part to make life on Earth the miracle that it is. In this lively book, George Hudler leads us on a tour of an often-overlooked group of organisms, which differ radically from both animals and plants. Along the way the author stops to ponder the marvels of nature and the impact of mere microbes on the evolution of civilization. Nature's ultimate recyclers not only save us from drowning in a sea of organic waste, but also provide us with food, drink, and a wide array of valuable medicines and industrial chemicals.</p><br><p> Some fungi make deadly poisons and psychedelic drugs that have interesting histories in and of themselves, and Hudler weaves tales of those into his scientific account of the nature of the fungi. The role of fungi in the Irish potato famine, in the Salem Witch Trials, in the philosophical writings of Greek scholars, and in the creation of ginger snaps are just a few of the many great moments in history to grace these pages.</p><br><p> Hudler moves so easily from discussing human history to exploring scientific knowledge, all with a sense of humor and enthusiasm, that one can well understand why he is an award-winning teacher both at Cornell University as well as nationally. Few, for instance, who read his invitation to "get out of your chair and take a short walk" will ever again look without curiosity and admiration at the "rotten" part of the world around them. <i>Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds </i>is full of information that will satisfy history buffs, science enthusiasts, and anyone interested in nature's miracles. Everyone in Hudler's audience will develop a new appreciation of the debt they owe to the molds for such common products as penicillin, wine, and bread.</p></p><p>Oh, to be young and eligible to enroll in Professor George Hudler's "Plant Pathology 101" class at Cornell! For those of us who aren't, this book is the next best thing--a hugely entertaining introduction to spore lore. Not only does he bring us up to speed on the fungus science, he relates the amazing impact of his branch of science on human history. The Eleusinian Mysteries that so inspired Plato and Sophocles were probably caused by ergot, which Tim Leary and the CIA put to scarier use in its refined form, LSD. Other fungal products are more upbeat: penicillin (Hudler tells a good story about British scientists who put its spores on their clothes in 1940, to preserve their research in case Germany invaded), cyclosporins, which permit such organ recipients as David Crosby not to reject their healthy new livers, and Beano, a derivative of alpha-d-galactosidase that suppresses flatulence in humans. Want to commit the perfect murder? Try aflatoxin, as a Graham Greene character does in <i>The Human Factor</i>. Do you dare to recreate the hallucinations of the Salem witches? Ergot's just the thing, as characters discover to their misfortune in Robin Cook's thriller <i>Acceptable Risk</i>. Hudler packs plenty of intriguing stories into a brief, readable book: exploding artillery fungus, spores spread by earthquakes that can cause anorexia, a 35-acre spread of 1,500-year-old identical mushrooms in Michigan that may be the oldest, biggest living thing on Earth. No question about it--Dr. Hudler is one fun guy. <i>--Tim Appelo</i><p>"Hudler's light-hearted approach to the subject of the impact of fungi on human history is refreshing and will attract students and lay people who have some interest in this area. Better yet, it will entice readers who were not concerned with this topic at all before delving into the book. . . . [Hudler] is to be commended for discovering some extremely exciting information, some of it little known even to mycologists."<b>--James W.

She would go on to win some of the most coveted awards in literature&#x2014;the Booker Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. <br><br>Now, in an impeccable match of talent between biographer and subject, Hermione Lee, a master biographer and one of Fitzgerald's greatest champions, gives us this remarkable writer&#x2019;s story. Lee&#x2019;s critical expertise is on dazzling display on every page, as it illuminates this extraordinary English life. Fitzgerald, born into an accomplished intellectual family, the granddaughter of two bishops, led a life marked by dramatic twists of fate, moving from a bishop&#x2019;s palace to a sinking houseboat to a last, late blaze of renown. We see Fitzgerald&#x2019;s very English childhood in the village of Hampstead; her Oxford years, when she was known as the &#x201c;blonde bombshell&#x201d;; her impoverished adulthood as a struggling wife, mother and schoolteacher, raising a family in difficult circumstances; and the long-delayed start to her literary career. <br><br>Fitzgerald&#x2019;s early novels draw on her own experiences&#x2014;working at the BBC in wartime, at a bookshop in Suffolk, at an eccentric stage school in the 1960s&#x2014;while her later books open out into historical worlds that she, magically, seems to entirely possess: Russia before the Revolution, postwar Italy, Germany in the time of the Romantic writer Novalis. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s novels are short, spare masterpieces, and Hermione Lee unfurls them here as works of genius. Expertly researched, written out of love and admiration for this wonderful author&#x2019;s work, <i>Penelope Fitzgerald</i> is literary biography at its finest&#x2014;an unforgettable story of lateness, persistence and survival.</p><p>Hermione Lee is a biographer, critic, teacher of literature, and president of Wolfson College, University of Oxford.

The Bishop&#x2019;s younger daughter, Christina Frances, had said goodbye to her husband, Eddie Knox, in peacetime a journalist and poet, now second lieutenant in the Lincolns, a regiment he had joined because of its connection to her family home. He was waiting to embark for France. They had been married four years and had a �three-�year-�old son, Rawle. Christina was �thirty-�one, and heavily pregnant. She and Eddie had set up home in rural Hampstead, but because of the war she had moved into the Palace with Rawle and a young nursemaid, to have their second child under her parents&#x2019; care.<br><br>But the Bishop, Edward Lee Hicks, and his wife, Agnes, were under strain. They had thrown open the Palace at the start of the war to a group of pitiful Belgian refugees, some of whom were still living nearby and doing odd jobs for them. Lincoln, because it had munitions factories, was a target for Zeppelin raids. The town was full of �war-�wounded and displaced persons and housewives coping with bereavements, air raids and rationing. The Bishop was shocked to see police controlling huge queues for margarine at the shops. He was working so �hard&#x2014;�visiting camps and hospitals, protesting against the �ill-�treatment of conscientious objectors, giving sermons all over the �country&#x2014;�that he had come down with a dangerous attack of the flu. Agnes was doing everything.<br><br>He was too ill to see Christina when her baby, Penelope Mary Knox, was born, without much fuss, on the Sunday afternoon of 17 December 1916. The Bishop was still not well enough to officiate at the baptism on 18 January 1917. Penelope Mary was baptised by the Dean of Lincoln, with two aunts from either side of her family (Eddie �Knox&#x2019;s sister Ethel and Christina&#x2019;s �sister-�in-�law Margaret Alison Hicks) as her sponsors. Her given names, though, were never used by the family. She was always called Mops, or Mopsie, or Mopsa.<br><br>The great frost lasted into March. The Bishop had barely recovered from his illness, and his granddaughter was only a few months old, when the news came of his oldest son&#x2019;s death. Christina&#x2019;s brother Edwin Hicks caught trench fever at Amiens, then died of an attack of meningitis. The Bishop, a pacifist who opposed the war, asked that &#x201c;nothing about &#x2018;victory&#x2019; should be put on the grave of his dead son.&#x201d; The young widow, Margaret Alison, married for less than two years, bore up valiantly: this was a comfort to his parents. Weeks later, Bishop Hicks and his family turned the Old Palace over to the Red Cross for a hospital, and moved into a much smaller house, cramped quarters for Christina, her parents, her little boy and the new baby.<br><br>In September 1917, Eddie Knox, who had been shooting rats in the trenches, observing &#x201c;ordinary behaviour under terrible conditions&#x201d; and finding himself unable to write comic pieces from the front line for Punch, was reported missing. He had been shot in the back by a sniper at the Battle of Passchendaele, then found in a �shell hole in a pool of blood. He was invalided out, operated on, and brought to a Lincoln hospital to convalesce. Christina, meanwhile, was playing her part on the home front, looking after the children, helping her father, and organising an exhibition of women&#x2019;s war work at the local branch of Boots. In April 1919, when Eddie was finally demobbed, she was being visited by the Hickses in a Lincoln hospital for women and children, and was said to be only slowly improving; perhaps she had had a miscarriage. Just then, the Bishop, finally worn out, retired from his duties. He died in August 1919. Christina and her children were at his bedside, but Penelope, aged two, was too young to remember. Nevertheless, Bishop Hicks was a figure who mattered to her, among the bishops, missionaries, vicars and priests thickly scattered through her family tree. She liked the sound of him.<br><br>Edward Lee Hicks never refused to see anyone who came to his door for help. He was a great enemy of poverty and injustice, having come, while he was at Oxford, under the influence of John Ruskin. Ruskin he admired, not only for his teaching but also for his delight in even the smallest details of life. Ruskin, he said, would describe &#x201c;with the keenest relish&#x201d; the joy of shelling peas:<br><br>&#x201c;The pop which assures one of a successful start, the fresh colour and scent of the juicy row within, and the pleasure of skilfully scooping the bouncing peas with one&#x2019;s thumb into the vessel by one&#x2019;s side.&#x201d; I can honestly say that I never shell peas in summer without thinking of Ruskin and of my grandfather.<br><br>Shelling peas was the right association, since the Hickses were originally a farming family. So were the Pughs, the Bishop&#x2019;s maternal family. The Hickses farmed in Wolvercote, a village on the northern edge of Oxford that looks over Port Meadow and the River Thames. They were an �old-fashioned Church of �En�gland family who �didn&#x2019;t like Methodists coming into the village. But Edward Hicks, the future Bishop&#x2019;s father, married Catherine Pugh, a �strong-�minded person who lived to a great age, one of eleven poor children of a musical Welsh father and a devout Wesleyan mother. Because of his marriage Edward Hicks became a Methodist. So his son Edward Lee Hicks grew up with a mixed religious background. Since the Hicks/Knox families contained Quakers, Ulster Protestants, Wesleyans, Evangelicals, Anglicans, �Anglo-�Catholics and Roman Catholics, some not on speaking terms with one another, Penelope Fitzgerald developed a belief that religious schisms are pointless, and that all different faiths are �really one. She draws attention to this in The Knox Brothers, when calling the faiths that maintained the Knoxes in their dark hours, or &#x201c;the Bishop of Lincoln&#x2019;s when his son died in the trenches, or Christina&#x2019;s when she got a telegram to say that Eddie was missing,&#x201d; not greater or lesser faiths, &#x201c;but the same.&#x201d; Where she agreed with both her grandparents was that faith was necessary for life.<br><br>Both Edward Hicks and Catherine Pugh had fathers who died young (Edward&#x2019;s fell off a ladder pruning a Wolvercote fruit tree), and Edward Hicks, too, died early. An argumentative, musical, generous person, he was a �hopeless businessman, who went into debt and died of consumption when his son Edward Lee was nine. Catherine ran the fatherless family, and got Edward Lee into Magdalen School as a chorister. He remembered the shame of being a poor boy at school among richer boys. But he grew up into a scholar and an Oxford don, teaching at Corpus Christi College in the 1860s when Ruskin was there, and when Oxford was, in Fitzgerald&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;spiritually in low water&#x201d; after Newman&#x2019;s departure and the fiercely divisive Tractarian wars. One of Edward Lee Hicks&#x2019;s students at Corpus was Edmund Arbuthnott Knox. The Hickses and the Knoxes would keep on �interconnecting.<br><br>Hicks was ordained in 1870; he was also by then an expert in Greek epigraphy, known at the British Museum for &#x201c;a happy ability in restoring �half-�destroyed inscriptions.&#x201d; So when he was offered the country living of Fenny �Compton&#x2014;�a backwater between Banbury and Leamington �Spa&#x2014;�for about �600 a year, in 1873, and married a vicar&#x2019;s daughter, Agnes Trevelyan Smith, he could have settled into a modestly comfortable combination of scholarship, rural ministry and domestic life, with six children (one of whom died in infancy) born between 1878 and 1892.<br><br>But Edward Lee Hicks was not an �easy-�living person. His years at Fenny Compton were a time of agricultural depression and farm workers&#x2019; strikes. He sympathised with and worked on behalf of the &#x201c;land-�hungry&#x201d; labourers. He was a Liberal who believed in grassroots social reform. In the 1880s he and the family moved to a huge, poor parish in Manchester, where he took his double life, as a social reformer and classical scholar, into a tough urban environment. But the move meant that scholarship, the quiet, happy deciphering of Greek inscriptions, had to give way entirely to public work. As Rector at Salford and Canon of Manchester Cathedral, he also wrote polemical �pieces&#x2014;�for instance, against the Boer �War&#x2014;�for his friend C. P. Scott at the Manchester Guardian. One of the clerics he disagreed with was his �ex-�pupil Edmund Knox, now his bishop at Manchester, who ran a loud national campaign for the retention of church schools, which were under �threat&#x2014;�while Canon Hicks thought that parents should have the right to have their children taught according to their own beliefs.<br><br>Some people thought Hicks was too dangerously radical to be made a bishop, and the appointment came late in his life. He had nine years at Lincoln, but he made the most of them. His obituaries called him &#x201c;a �progressive prelate&#x201d; and &#x201c;a friend of the poor.&#x201d; It �wasn&#x2019;t only for his �pea shelling that Bishop Hicks admired Ruskin. Ruskin&#x2019;s �dictum&#x2014;�There is no wealth but �life&#x2014;�was his own, and he used Ruskin&#x2019;s attack on the immorality of capitalism, Unto This Last, as a text for his sermons. In &#x201c;Christianity and Riches,&#x201d; given at Cambridge in 1913, he preached that the Church suffered from being associated with the comfortable, wealthy classes. But &#x201c;all must refuse to value anyone the more because of his riches.&#x201d; His granddaughter, who also admired Ruskin, agreed.<br><br>He understood poverty because he had experienced it. Fitzgerald wrote, with feeling, of Bishop Hicks&#x2019;s family: &#x201c;Occasionally they would write down a list of all the things they wanted but �couldn&#x2019;t afford, and then burn the piece of paper. This is a device which is always worth trying.&#x201d; All her life, Christina could never take a taxi without feeling guilty: &#x201c;cabby&#x201d; was her word for &#x201c;expensive.&#x201d; There were other things, too, she got from her father. Hicks was a feminist, school of John Stuart Mill. He tried unsuccessfully to persuade his fellow bishops to take the clause about &#x201c;obeying&#x201d; out of the Marriage Service in the Prayer Book, and he supported women&#x2019;s suffrage. Christina Hicks inherited those beliefs. Her father gave her, and her brothers and sister, free choices. All the children, Christina wrote eloquently, were encouraged to talk to him as equals. They consulted him as though he were an encyclopaedia. &#x201c;He never laughed at us, and always contrived to make us feel that we had asked something �really interesting.&#x201d; They were taught that things should be &#x201c;perfectly simple&#x201d; but good of their �kind&#x2014;&#x201c;a book well printed and bound, for instance, that �didn&#x2019;t crack when it was opened.&#x201d; He liked games, music, walks, funny stories and beautiful objects; he hated tyranny and ugliness. He believed in equal opportunities for boys and girls. When he and Agnes moved to Lincoln in �1910&#x2014;�Christina was then �twenty-�five, with a university �education&#x2014;�she was &#x201c;offered the choice of going away to make a career for myself, or of being �&#x2018;home-�daughter,&#x2019; whichever I pleased . . . I have never known a daughter so treated, and I have asked many.&#x201d;<br><br>i<br><br>We hardly hear that thoughtful, intelligent voice of Christina&#x2019;s in her daughter&#x2019;s family �memories&#x2014;�either in The Knox Brothers or in other later pieces about her �childhood&#x2014;�where the mother mainly exists as a silence or an absence, and appears first as &#x201c;a gentle, spirited, scholarly, �hazel-�eyed girl, a lover of poetry and music . . . ready to laugh at herself &#x201d; and later as &#x201c;a quietly spoken woman whom nothing defeated.&#x201d; In Granny �Pugh&#x2019;s letters to her �daughter-�in-�law Agnes about the children, Christina figures as an admirable granddaughter. In 1896, when she was eleven: &#x201c;It is grateful to me to hear that Christina is fond of poetry. She always seemed to me a child of promise.&#x201d; In 1897: &#x201c;I am so glad that Christina has distinguished herself.&#x201d; At Withington Girls&#x2019; School in Manchester, she took the lead in school plays. In 1904 she got a scholarship for �40 a year to Somerville, one of the first women&#x2019;s colleges in Oxford.<br><br>Her daughter would be amused by the letter which came with the scholarship, &#x201c;reminding her that she must change her dress for dinner, but &#x2018;must bring no �fal-�lals, as they only collect dust.&#x2019; &#x201d; Her tutors thought her &#x201c;decidedly promising&#x201d; if a little immature, &#x201c;animated and intelligent,&#x201d; with good skills in logic. Helen Darbishire, the Milton and Wordsworth scholar, then senior �En�glish Tutor, thought that she wrote with &#x201c;taste and �judgement,&#x201d; but needed &#x201c;to cultivate more �self-�confidence.&#x201d; She was active on college committees, writing careful minutes as secretary (&#x201c;Miss Hicks drew attention to complaints which she had received from members whose mackintoshes and umbrellas had been borrowed without permission&#x201d;) and allowing herself some light moments: &#x201c;Miss Blake delivered a stirring �exhortation on the subject of the Fiction Library&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Rules about Sleeping Out: No one may consciously sleep out in the rain!&#x201d; She worked hard, went to dances, had a &#x201c;beau&#x201d; or two, won the College Coombs prize, made friends with the future novelist Rose Macaulay, and left in 1907 with a Second Class in �En�glish, though she could not take her degree until 1921, the year after Oxford at last started awarding degrees to women. Possibly Oxford&#x2019;s discriminatory attitudes, as well as her father&#x2019;s support, fuelled Christina&#x2019;s involvement, in 1908, in demonstrations and mass meetings in support of the Women&#x2019;s Suffrage Bill.<br><br>Her father grieved over Edwin&#x2019;s death and over the defection of his youngest son, Ned, who, after being wounded on the Somme, converted to Roman Catholicism under the influence of Ronald Knox. But the Bishop was proud of &#x201c;Tina&#x2019;s&#x201d; scholarly achievements. He was close to his younger daughter. When she went abroad after Oxford, he advised her: &#x201c;Try to use all the chances that come to you of learning about the habits and conditions of the people.&#x201d; When she asked him about belief, he sent her a long letter, which concluded: &#x201c;The sound Christian is largely an agnostic.&#x201d; When he gave her the choice in 1910 of being a &#x201c;home-�daughter&#x201d; or having a career, she went to teach at St. Felix School in Southwold. The Bishop approved of that as much as he did of her engagement to Eddie Knox, son of his old acquaintance the Bishop of Manchester, in 1912.<br><br>Christina and Eddie met in Oxford, probably introduced by her younger brother Ned, who, at Magdalen School, had already brought home an admirer for his sister, his fellow chorister Ivor Novello, who on family holidays followed her about devotedly. Nobody wanted the engagement to be long. One sensible bishop&#x2019;s wife, Mrs. Hicks, conferred with the other, Mrs. Knox: &#x201c;Christina says . . . it does seem such a long time till May! She is anxious because he is lonely . . .&#x201d; They were married in St. �Hugh&#x2019;s Chapel in Lincoln Cathedral on 17 September 1912. It was a family affair.</p><h2>Jo Sonja&#39;s Guide to Decorative Painting: Traditional Inspirations/Contemporary Expressions</h2><p>Written by the premier decorative painter of our time, this book is the most complete decorative painting resource ever assembled in one volume.</p><p></p><h2>Peek-a Boo!</h2><p>In this third title in Nina Laden&#x2019;s Peek-a series, the classic game of peekaboo becomes spookily fun!

Vasquez is now a member of the Colonial Country Club, where he serves on the board of governors for the annual Colonial, the longest-running site on the PGA Tour and the tournament Hogan won five times.Despite legendary golfer Ben Hogan's reported gruffness, reluctance to give interviews and inability to make polite small talk, people liked him. Especially first-time author Vasquez, who, at the age of 17, got a job shagging practice balls at Shady Oaks Country Club in Fort Worth, Tex., for the four-time U.S. Open champion, whom many still consider the greatest golfer in history. This slender volume, penned 36 years later, contains enlightening personal anecdotes and astounding golf tips that will thrill any enthusiast, including the secret to Hogan's legendary golf swing (hint" it's in the stance). "The Secret" was not revealed in Hogan's enormously popular book Five Lessons, or, apparently, to any other person than Vasquez before or since Hogan's death in 1997 (with once exception: Vasquez secretly shared it with golfer Nick Faldo in 1989), but it is revealed to all here with the blessing of Hogan's widow, Valerie. Outstanding chapters include the meeting between Faldo and Hogan, with the latter intimidating the "out-of-town guy," and a poignant explanation of why Hogan was such a bad putter later in life. Hogan was "[d]riven to excellence, focused on winning, relentlessly hardworking, bent on improving, intensely competitive, intimidating and aloof to opponents, analytical, consumed by detail and equally dependent on skill and power." He was also quietly generous, intensely loyal and brimming with personal integrity. Vasquez's unique position and 20-year relationship with the champion allowed him access to all of Ben Hogan. In an easygoing, conversational writing style, the stories Vasquez relates here are the rich fruits of that relationship and should not be missed. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a result of these acclamations, this book is considered one of the greatest novels written on the Civil War.</p><p>This novel reveals more about the Battle of Gettysburg than any piece of learned nonfiction on the same subject. Michael Shaara&#39;s account of the three most important days of the Civil War features deft characterizations of all of the main actors, including Lee, Longstreet, Pickett, Buford, and Hancock. The most inspiring figure in the book, however, is Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, whose 20th Maine regiment of volunteers held the Union&#39;s left flank on the second day of the battle. This unit&#39;s bravery at Little Round Top helped turned the tide of the war against the rebels. There are also plenty of maps, which convey a complete sense of what happened July 1-3, 1863. Reading about the past is rarely so much fun as on these pages.It's hard to limit myself when talking about this book because it is simply one of the best books I've ever read. But it wasn't until the second reading that I appreciated this. I read it in college, among the million other books an English major must read, and I liked it. Then, when we published Gods and Generals, I figured I'd read Killer Angels again, just to refresh my memory. And it was if I'd never read it before. Names and places that had simply been history before now took on new meaning and importance. It gave me a whole new understanding of the Civil War and the why's of it all. Killer Angels is simply a book that everyone should read.<br>Lisa Congelosi, Ballantine Sales Rep.</p><h2>The Acme Novelty Library (Pantheon Graphic Library)</h2><p>Utterly eschewing the general bonhomie surrounding the newly-minted contemporary regard for the comic strip medium as a language of complicated personal expression and artistic sophistication, professional colorist and award-winning letterer F. C. Ware returns to the book trade with &#x201c;The ACME Novelty Library,&#x201d; a hardcover distillation of all his surviving one-page cartoon jokes with which he tuckpointed the holes of his regular comic book periodical over the past decade. <br><br>Sometimes claimed to be his &#x201c;best work&#x201d; by those who really don&#x2019;t know any better, this definitive congestion of stories of the future, the old west, and even of modern life nonetheless tries to stay interesting by including a luminescent map of the heavens, a chart of the general structure of the universe, assorted cut-out activitites, and a complete history of The ACME Novelty Company itself, decorated by rare photographs, early business ventures, not to mention the smallest example of a Comic Strip ever before offered to the general public. All in all, it will likely prove a rather mild disappointment, but at least it catches the light in a nice way and may force a smile here and there before being shelved for the next generation&#x2019;s ultimate disregard and/or disposal.</p><p>Chris Ware lives in Chicago, Illinois, with his wife, Marnie. He is the author of <i>Jimmy Corrigan &#x2014; the Smartest Kid on Earth</i>, which received the Guardian First Book Award in 2001 and was also included in the 2002 Whitney Biennial of American Art. He most recently edited the 13th issue of &#x201c;McSweeney&#x2019;s Quarterly Concern,&#x201d; and continues work on two upcoming genuinely serious graphic novels. The 16th issue of his regular periodical, not uncoincidentally titled &#x201c;The ACME Novelty Library,&#x201d; will be released this fall.<i>Starred Review.</i> With all his literary accolades and awards, it's easy to forget Ware <i>(Jimmy Corrigan) </i>is one of the warmest, funniest cartoonists in America. <i>The Acme Novelty Library </i>collects a few issues of Ware's comic book series by the same name and adds plenty of new pages and visual delights. It is, like all of his work, an utterly immersive experience. You're not just reading his comics, you're inhabiting his world: from fake ads to diagrams for paper models to a lengthy and very funny fictional history of the Acme Novelty Company. These strips combine complex and beautiful visuals with the humor of hapless, often sad characters in ridiculous predicaments. "Rusty Brown", a series of strips based around an obsessive collector who will be the subject of Ware's next graphic novel, is particularly strong. These comics showcase Ware's unusual sensitivity towards his characters, building an incisive, multi-dimensional portrait of Brown and his friend Chalky White. On top of all of these riches there is Ware's own personal "history of art" in cartoon form, and a multi-page story about a naked superhero. Combining surreal humor, cutting satire, stunning visuals, and empathic characters, Ware's latest is a wondrous journey into the universe of a master cartoonist in peak form. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 1347 the English capture Calais and the war with France is suspended by a truce. But for Thomas of Hookton, the hero of Harlequin and Vagabond, there is no end to the fighting. He is pursuing the grail, the most sacred of Christendom&#39;s relics, and is sent to his ancestral homeland, Gascony, to engineer a confrontation with his deadliest enemy, Guy Vexille. Once in the south country Thomas becomes a raider, leading his archers in savage forays that will draw his enemy to his arrows. But then his fortunes change. Thomas becomes the hunted as his campaign is destroyed by the church. With only one companion, a girl condemned to burn as a heretic, Thomas goes to the valley of Astarac where he believes the grail was once hidden and might still be concealed, and there he plays a deadly game of hide and seek with an overwhelming enemy.

Part 1 Your Marriage Makeover Begins with You Chapter 1 The Glory of a Godly Woman Understanding Who You Are in Christ I laughed out loud when I saw it. While waiting in line at a grocery store, I read the cover of a leading women&#39;s magazine and just had to write down the title of one of its articles: &#39;Why so many smart, good women put up with snarly, dreadful men.&#39; You know what made me laugh? I can&#39;t even imagine a leading men&#39;s magazine --- say, GQ or Esquire --- with an article titled &#39;Why so many honorable, decent men put up with conniving, manipulative women.&#39; It would never happen. Nor will you ever see books titled Men Who Love Too Much or The Men-Haters and the Men Who Love Them. There&#39;s a good reason for this. Historically, neurologically, socially, and even biblically, I believe one can make the case that women tend to be more invested in their relationships and marriages than are men. As my friend Dr. Melody Rhode, a psychologist and marriage and family therapist, puts it, &#39;Women are bent to their husbands; we just are.&#39; This reality has its roots in the very first family. Back in Genesis 3, following the fall, God tells Eve, &#39;Your desire will be for your husband&#39; (verse 16). Respected Old Testament commentators Keil and Delitzsch suggest that the Hebrew language here evokes a &#39;desire bordering on disease.&#39;1 It comes from a root word connoting a &#39;violent craving&#39; for something. Some women exhibit more of this than others. I recently listened to a talk program in which a woman described how her husband had carried on a secret affair for more than four years. The husband had acted cruelly on many fronts. He had introduced his mistress to his wife, for example, and in his wife&#39;s absence he had brought the mistress home. In fact, he even took his mistress into his wife&#39;s bed. The illicit relationship ended only when the mistress died. But do you know what most surprised me about the call? The wife seemed more concerned about losing this despicable man than she did about facing a life without him! Even though he had disrespected her as deeply as possible, trampled on their marital intimacy, and offended their marriage bed, she felt more afraid of waking up without him than of waking up next to him. In fact, she really wanted to find out more about the mistress! What did she look like? What kind of personality did she have? What did her husband see in her? Contrast this with a recent question-and-answer article in Sports Illustrated, in which a number of professional male athletes were asked if they would ever take back a &#39;runaway bride,&#39; a woman who left them at the altar and embarrassed them in front of their family and friends. Not a single athlete said he would. One of the men responded so vehemently and colorfully that I can&#39;t even print his answer in this book. Why the discrepancy? In some cases, it may indeed be that women are more spiritually and emotionally mature, willing to forgive for the sake of the family and larger considerations. But in other cases, it might be less noble than that. Some women never rise above a sinful propensity to define themselves according to their likability --- or acceptance --- by men. Unfortunately, some men seem to have an ultrasensitive spiritual radar that picks up on this. They somehow intuit a woman&#39;s spiritual neediness and will exploit it for their own ends. Because of Christ&#39;s work and the conquering power of the Holy Spirit, however, Christian women can be set free from such psychological dependency and destruction. Listen to a passage from 1 Corinthians 7, as rendered by Eugene Peterson in The Message: &#39;And don&#39;t be wishing you were someplace else or with someone else. Where you are right now is God&#39;s place for you. Live and obey and love and believe right there. God, not your marital status, defines your life&#39; (verse 17). Did you catch that last line? God, not your marital status, defines your life. Is this true of you? The more it is, the more success you will have in moving your man, because weak women usually forfeit their influence. Look at this from a very practical perspective: do you care much about what a person for whom you have little respect thinks of you? Probably not. So then, how is such a person going to influence you? When their opinion doesn&#39;t matter, they may communicate clearly, honestly, and practically --- but you&#39;re still not going to listen to them. In the same way, if your husband doesn&#39;t respect you, if you have sinfully put his acceptance of you over your identity as a daughter of God, then how will you ever influence him for the better? Now let&#39;s put a positive spin on this. If someone you really respect, greatly admire, and enjoy spending time with comes to you with a concern, aren&#39;t you going to give their words extra thought? Aren&#39;t you at least going to consider that they may have a point, and that you need to pay attention? Of course you are. This explains why the type of woman who moves her man is a woman who also impresses her man. I heard one husband gush about his wife&#39;s business acumen, while another raved about his wife&#39;s intelligence. Yet a third man went on and on about his wife&#39;s spiritual maturity and her ability to understand the Bible.</p><h2>Magic Reindeer: a Christmas Wish</h2><p>When lonely Marie moves from Poland to a new school, all she wants to do is make a friend.

Lillegard's lumbering, aggrandized verse ("Celestine was filled, filled full/ with energy!/ Celestine was thrilled, thrilled through/ with energy!") relates the journey of young Celestine, who loses his way in the woods and ends up on a quest for life's deeper meaning. "Swirled and set in a strange, medieval world," he witnesses wars, wanders into a flower-filled field, fights a warrior to keep his "energy" and is finally told to go home by a flock of butterflies (and led by a deer), all the while pondering such platitudes as "Pay attention?now and to the past," "Love," "Dream," "Share," "Rejoice." There's not enough of a story here to engage the attention of young readers, nor are they likely to grasp the cloaked meaning (e.g., some readers may suspect the "warrior" plays a larger role, but never discover what that might be). Conversely, Morrissey's (The Great Kettles) gleaming oil paintings, with their painstaking detail, masterful use of light and deep, saturated colors, remain grounded in reality, with a delicate hint of spiritual forces at work (e.g., a swirling path of moon and stars). His artwork?which, particularly in the still-life scenes, recalls the works of the Dutch masters?plants the seeds for Celestine's epiphany, showing a glimpse of the boy's room in an early scene, with all the elements (flowers, a butterfly, blocks that spell out "home") foreshadowed. Yet even the stellar artwork is not enough to hoist this book out of its pompous mire. All ages. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 2-Celestine, a neat kid undaunted by being dressed in a jerkin and toting a lute, is having a bad day. Feeling "unloved, unheard, unseen" makes him "cold, afraid, alone." Out of the blue, some leaves, ants, a door, clouds, and a shadow spell out bits and pieces of a life-changing message: "'Pay attention-now and to the past./To flowers. To faces.' He was home at last./And the choir sang in a single voice,/'Love. Dream. Share. Rejoice!'" That's it, folks. The text mentions struggle, a warrior, a fight-but all readers ever see is the tousle-haired cherub posing amiably with some quasi-medieval props. This sweet message has been very successful for James Redfield in his adult book The Celestine Prophecy, and this decorative volume is likely to be cherished by parents looking for insights on the most uncontroversial level. Who could argue, even if it's in doggerel, when the hero, painted in superrealistic oils on canvas, is so photogenic? Like him, this book will never be alone-it will fly off library shelves into the spiritual vacuum out there.<br><i>Patricia Lothrop-Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Cross and Christian Ministry: Leadership Lessons from 1 Corinthians</h2><p>First published by Baker Books in 1993, The Cross and Christian Ministry presents a comprehensive view of what the death of Christ means in preaching and pastoring God&#39;s people.

Tour.</p><p>This handsome tome is packed to the gills with paintings, and while readers might disagree with any of Sister Wendy Beckett's choices (that's half the fun, perhaps), there are still hundreds of unforgettable works of art that nearly any reader can appreciate. Most of the pictures, even those that seem unprepossessing at first glance, are made riveting by Sister Wendy's quirky, personal narratives, in which the simplest of images is suddenly rendered a dramatic focal point. A perfectly ordinary Dutch scene by Hendrick Avercamp--<i>Frozen River</i>, 1620--shows people going about their business on a lively patch of ice where children play hockey and adults chat and work. Sister Wendy seizes on a fishing hole cut into the ice through which a circle of cold, black water is apparent. "The hole that has been cut in the ice can frighten us when our eye falls into it, and this is the only hint of the inherent danger of the scene," she writes ominously. In Anthony Van Dyck's magnificent portrait of Charles I of England, she observes of his regal hauteur, "In hindsight we can see the tragedy: that a man so remote from common humanity, so superb in his conceit, must be heading for a fall." <p> There are bound to be some infelicitous matches in a book that is arranged alphabetically, such as the pages shared by Robert Mangold's hot, geometric <i>Four Color Frame Painting No. 1</i>, 1983, and Andrea Mantegna's profoundly reverent <i>Dead Christ</i>, 1480. And Rosalba Carriera's portraits look decidedly meretricious across from those of the masterful Mary Cassatt. But all in all, this is a page-turner with brief captions that offer guidance to any reader in search of the telling note that draws one to a work of art, whatever its era, style, size, or subject. <i>--Martha Hardin</i></p>Sister Wendy Beckett is a member of the Notre Dame order, a teaching order of nuns.

She&#x2019;d grown accustomed to shopping at outlet malls, discount stores like T.J. Maxx, and cheap but trendy retailers like Forever 21, Target, and H&amp;M. She was buying a new item of clothing almost every week (the national average is sixty-four per year) but all she had to show for it was a closet and countless storage bins packed full of low-quality fads she barely wore&#x2014;including the same sailor-stripe tops and fleece hoodies as a million other shoppers. When she found herself lugging home seven pairs of identical canvas flats from Kmart (a steal at $7 per pair, marked down from $15!), she realized that something was deeply wrong.<br> Cheap fashion has fundamentally changed the way most Americans dress. Stores ranging from discounters like Target to traditional chains like JCPenney now offer the newest trends at unprecedentedly low prices. Retailers are pro�ducing clothes at enormous volumes in order to drive prices down and profits up, and they&#x2019;ve turned clothing into a disposable good. After all, we have little reason to keep wearing and repairing the clothes we already own when styles change so fast and it&#x2019;s cheaper to just buy more.<br> But what are we doing with all these cheap clothes? And more important, what are they doing to us, our society, our environment, and our economic well-being?<br> In <i>Overdressed, </i>Cline sets out to uncover the true nature of the cheap fashion juggernaut, tracing the rise of budget clothing chains, the death of middle-market and independent retail�ers, and the roots of our obsession with deals and steals. She travels to cheap-chic factories in China, follows the fashion industry as it chases even lower costs into Bangladesh, and looks at the impact (both here and abroad) of America&#x2019;s drastic increase in imports. She even explores how cheap fashion harms the charity thrift shops and textile recyclers where our masses of cloth�ing castoffs end up.<br> Sewing, once a life skill for American women and a pathway from poverty to the middle class for workers, is now a dead-end sweatshop job. The pressures of cheap have forced retailers to drastically reduce detail and craftsmanship, making the clothes we wear more and more uniform, basic, and low quality. Creative inde�pendent designers struggle to produce good and sustainable clothes at affordable prices.<br> Cline shows how consumers can break the buy-and-toss cycle by supporting innovative and stylish sustainable designers and retailers, refash�ioning clothes throughout their lifetimes, and mending and even making clothes themselves.<i><br> Overdressed </i>will inspire you to vote with your dollars and find a path back to being well dressed and feeling good about what you wear.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Cline </b>has written for AMCtv.com, <i>The Daily Beast, New York Magazine, Popular Science, The New Republic, The Village Voice, </i>and seedmagazine.com.

At the same time, it is a spiritual memoir of a man whose innovative system of cultivating the earth reflects a deep faith in the wholeness and balance of the natural world. As Wendell Berry writes in his preface, the book is valuable to us because it is at once practical and philosophical. It is an inspiring, necessary book about agriculture because it is not just about agriculture. Trained as a scientist, Fukuoka rejected both modern agribusiness and centuries of agricultural practice, deciding instead that the best forms of cultivation mirror nature s own laws. Over the next three decades he perfected his so-called do-nothing technique: commonsense, sustainable practices that all but eliminate the use of pesticides, fertilizer, tillage, and perhaps most significantly, wasteful effortWhether you re a guerrilla gardener or a kitchen gardener, dedicated to slow food or simply looking to live a healthier life, you will find something here you may even be moved to start a revolution of your own.</p><p>Masanobu Fukuoka (1913 2008) was born and raised on the Japanese island of Shikoku. He was the oldest son of a rice farmer who was also the local mayor. Fukuoka studied plant pathology and worked for number of years as a produce inspector in the customs office in Yokohama. But in 1938 he returned to his village home determined to put his ideas about natural farming into practice. During World War II, he worked for the Japanese government as a researcher on food production, managing to avoid military service until the final few months of the war. After the war, he returned to Shikoku to devote himself wholeheartedly to farming. And in 1975, distressed by the effects of Japan s post-war modernization, Fukuoka wrote The One-Straw Revolution. In his later years, Fukuoka was involved with several projects to reduce desertification throughout the world. He remained an active farmer until well into his eighties, and continued to give lectures until only a few years before his death at the age of ninety-five. Fukuoka is also the author of The Natural Way of Farming and The Road Back to Nature. In 1988 he received the Magsaysay Award for Public Service.Frances Moore Lapp� is author or co-author of sixteen books, including Diet for a Small Planet and Getting a Grip: Clarity, Creativity, and Courage in a World Gone Mad.

In a rousing tale that echoes the myths and legends of Ireland herself, young Honora Keeley and Michael Kelly wed and start a family, inhabiting a hidden Ireland where fishermen and tenant farmers find solace in their ancient faith, songs, stories, and communal celebrations. Selling both their catch--and their crops--to survive, these people subsist on the potato crop--their only staple food. But when blight destroys the potatoes three times in four years, a callous government and uncaring landlords turn a natural disaster into The Great Starvation that will kill one million. Honora and Michael vow their children will live. The family joins two million other Irish refugees in one of the greatest rescues in human history: the Irish Emigration to America. Danger and hardship await them there. Honora and her unconventional sister Maire watch their seven sons as they transform Chicago from a frontier town to the "City of the Century", fight the Civil War, and enlist in the cause of Ireland's freedom. The Kelly clan is victorious. This heroic story sheds brilliant light on the ancestors of today's 44 million Irish Americans. <br><br>In the author's colorful and eclectic life, she has written and directed award-winning documentaries on Irish subjects, as well as the dramatic feature <em>Proud.</em> She's been an associate producer on <em>Good Morning America</em> and <em>Saturday Night Live, </em>written books on Martin Scorsese, World War II, and Bosnia, and a novel based on her experiences as a former nun - <em>Special Intentions.</em> She is a frequent contributor to <em>Irish America Magazine</em> and has a PhD in English and Irish literature.</p><p>Mary Pat Kelly is the author of a novel <em>Special Intentions,</em> and nonfiction on subjects as varied as Martin Scorcese and the rescue of Scott O'Grady from Bosnia.

White and his son Joel both had a respect for beauty, simplicity, and practicality when it came to their work. For E.B., it was writing. He talks about these qualities in <i>The Elements of Style</i>, the classic guide to English-language usage, and he demonstrates them in works like <i>Charlotte's Web</i> and <i>Stuart Little</i>. For Joel, it was building and designing boats that are "simple of line yet sound in engineering, traditional above water and modern below." <i>A Unit of Water, a Unit of Time</i> is a touching, engaging look at the life, work, and influence of Joel White and the craft of boat making. <p> Whynott spent a year (June 1996 to July 1997) at White's boat yard in Brooklin, Maine. At the time, White was battling cancer, nearing the end of his life, and designing what would be his last boat, the W-76, a wooden racing yacht with "sublime lines and exquisite rigging." <i>A Unit of Water</i>, the result of that experience, traces White's life from his birth in 1930 to his childhood spent in New York and Maine, his naval architecture studies at MIT, and his eventual move to Brooklin, where he began working at the small boat yard that eventually became his own. In the early '80s, White and his crew stopped making fiberglass boats in favor of wooden ones; Brooklin, headquarters for <i>WoodenBoat</i> magazine and the WoodenBoat School, became the center of the wooden-boat revival and White something of a boat-building guru. The book looks closely at the art of boat making--shaping deck beams, making bronze chocks, boring holes through sternposts--and the many characters in the Brooklin boat-building community. It's very interesting stuff, and Whynott tells the story simply and thoughtfully, emulating White's philosophies. He also describes White's health battles with respect and poignancy and without getting overly sentimental. </p><p> Joel White was a man of few words who tended to downplay his accomplishments, but they shine through in <i>A Unit of Water</i>. One Brooklin boat builder, describing the "soul" of boats, could have been describing White: "Boats are live. They talk. The more poorly made boats talk more. The best-made boats don't talk as much. They're quiet--quiet soldiers, they call them." <i>--Andy Boynton</i></p>In a time when racing boats are mass-produced from synthetic materials, a dying breed of craftsman continues to build wooden sailboats of astonishing beauty. Boatbuilding is an ancient art, and Joel White was a master. Son of the legendary writer E.B. White, he was raised around boats and his designs were as sublime and graceful as his father's prose. At a boatyard in Maine, White and his closely knit team of builders brought scores of his creations from blueprints into the ocean.<p>In June 1996, six months after being diagnosed with cancer, Joel White began designing the W-76, an exquisite racing yacht. It was his final masterpiece. Douglas Whynott spent a year at Brooklin Boat Yard, observing as this design took shape, first in sketches and then during the painstaking building of the wooden craft.</p><p>The result is the poignant tale of both a genius at work and the people devoted to his art. Evoking E.B. White's New England and its salty residents, A UNIT OF WATER, A UNIT OF TIME is a classic portrait of dignity, charm, and humble magnificence -- and of a maritime community that keeps a vanishing world alive.</p></p><h2>Trailblazers (The Old West, Vol 3)</h2><p>The old West The Trailblazers</p><p></p><h2>Christmas In The Big House, Christmas In The Quarters (Coretta Scott King Author Award Winner)</h2><p>A lavishly illustrated historical book describes Christmas on a pre-Civil War plantation from the viewpoints of the big house family and the slave quarters.</p><p>Gr. 4-6, with interest for older readers. This unusual book shows life on a Virginia plantation in 1859. Beginning after the harvest is in, the narrative describes the preparations for the Christmas season and the celebrations that follow. The differences in resources, lifestyles, and traditions between the plantation owner's family and the slaves provides a continuous contrast. Although the slaves' hardships are evident, they are not sensationalized, and the slaves' relationships with Massa and Missus in the big house are drawn with more subtlety than in many other children's books on the period. The final scenes use ironic foreshadowing: the master tells his young daughter that she'll be old enough to have her own slave in 1865, and in the quarters, a mother tells her son not to speak of running away, because she has heard rumors of freedom coming. Dramatic, full-color illustrations throughout the book offer windows on the period, showing individualized portraits of the characters at work, at rest, and at play. Some may find this a romanticized picture of slavery, but appended notes provide background information and show the authors' research on the period. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i>On a Virginia plantation in 1859, the slaves work hard to get the Big House ready for Christmas, and to prepare their own Quarters for the "Big Times" also. As they describe the goings-on during the weeks before Christmas as well as the actual rituals of the day, the McKissacks carefully and convincingly delineate the discrepancies between the two milieux-from the physical settings to the people's differing appreciations of the holiday's riches. The contrast is startling and stirring. This is a book of significant dimension and importance, and could be read at any time of year. The authors also add riddles, rhymes, recipes and copious notes. Rendered in acrylic on board, Thompson's remarkably realistic paintings are charged with emotion and masterfully tie together the book's diverse contents.

Only billionaire J.P. Morgan was able to save the stock market.</p><p>Black Tuesday (1929): As the newly created Federal Reserve System repeatedly adjusted interest rates in all the wrong ways, investment trusts, the darlings of that decade, became the catalyst that caused the bubble to burst, and the Dow fell dramatically, leading swiftly to the Great Depression.</p><p>Black Monday (1987): When "portfolio insurance," a new tool meant to protect investments, instead led to increased losses, and corporate raiders drove stock prices above their real values, the Dow dropped an astonishing 22.6 percent in one day.</p><p>The Great Recession (2008): As homeowners began defaulting on mortgages, investment portfolios that contained them collapsed, bringing the nation's largest banks, much of the economy, and the stock market down with them.</p><p>The Flash Crash (2010): When one investment manager, using a runaway computer algorithm that was dangerously unstable and poorly understood, reacted to the economic turmoil in Greece, the stock market took an unprecedentedly sudden plunge, with the Dow shedding 998.5 points (roughly a trillion dollars in valuation) in just minutes.</p><p>The stories behind the great crashes are filled with drama, human foibles, and heroic rescues. Taken together they tell the larger story of a nation reaching enormous heights of financial power while experiencing precipitous dips that alter and reset a market where millions of Americans invest their savings, and on which they depend for their futures. Scott Nations vividly shows how each of these major crashes played a role in America's political and cultural fabric, each providing painful lessons that have strengthened us and helped us to build the nation we know today.</p><p><em>A History of the United States in Five Crashes</em> clearly and compellingly illustrates the connections between these major financial collapses and examines the solid, clear-cut lessons they offer for preventing the next one.</p></p><p><p>Scott Nations is the president of NationsShares, a financial engineering firm.

Using Hermann Haindl's lush depiction of the Tree of Life, Rachel Pollack examines the message behind this ancient symbol. She takes a non-denominational approach - drawing upon unusual sources such as tribal and shamanic traditions, modern science, contemporary Kabbalists, tarot interpreters, and a comic book writer - to explore the Tree's meaning. Along the way, we learn more about Kabbalah's history, texts, mystical concepts, and why this esoteric tradition has sprung up again in the twenty-first century. <br></p><p>Rachel &nbsp;is considered one of the World&#x2019;s foremost authorities on the modern interpretation of the Tarot.

Strong, graceful, its branches reach up like long fingers into the sky. It is hundreds, maybe thousands of years old. And now think of a tree older than all, a tree whose trunk and branches connect heaven and earth, whose roots reach down into the dark mysteries below our normal consciousness, into the very origins of existence; a tree of dreams, a tree of beauty, a tree of God.A tree of life. Is our world, with all its complications, hopes, and dangers, no more than a child's treehouse set in a vast tree that stretches through worlds upon worlds? <br> <br>Now play with this image. If the tree is the connection of all life, does it begin in the dark underworld, stretch up through the existence we narrowly think of as "reality," and reach beyond to the spiritual heaven we imagine as somewhere far above our heads? But suppose all life, all existence beg ins with the Cr eator. Shouldn't the tree begin in "heaven"? And suppose our true home lies not in the world of pain and sorrow but in the divine perfection, what the legendary Welsh shaman/bard Taliesin called "the region of the summer stars." If the tree has its roots in heaven, and its branches reach down to us, does that mean that the tree grows upside down? Maybe we are upside down-that is, confused and seeing reality the wrong way around. If we could learn to see the true way, from the point of view of the divine rather than our ordinary "common sense" view (for that which is commonly agreed on is not necessarily true), then maybe the Tree of Life would stand revealed to us.And maybe we could learn to climb the tree and return to our roots as divine creations, made in the image of the Creator but ignorant of what that really means. <br> <br>People climb trees. They find their way, branch by branch, into the higher regions. Before the invention of machines of flight-balloons, gliders, airplanes-giant trees were the only way people could leave the surface of the earth. So a tree becomes a ladder, and if the tree reaches high enough it becomes a ladder to heaven itself. <br> <br>Now this is a literal image, and we should not confuse ourselves and believe there actually is a tree somewhere, or a giant ladder, that climbs up into the sky (why, in fact, should heaven be literally above us, in the sky?).And we should not believe that people in ancient times were much more simple-minded than our sophisticated selves, and so believed in such concrete trees and ladders. Images are metaphors,ways to make real in our minds what we understand as intuition. <br> <br>A tree that reaches into heaven, however, is a very vivid and enticing metaphor, and so has proved useful to humans the world over as a way to formulate our desire to encounter the divine. In the set of traditions known as shamanism (the word comes from a specific people in Siberia but describes practices and religious approaches found wherever humans have lived), healers and visionaries travel in trance to the spirit world.To aid their journeys they use the literal image, sometimes a pole or even a small tree, sometimes a ladder.They will set this up in the ceremony, and when they enter trance they will experience a climb up the tree or ladder into the realm of the gods, where they may find some power object or even battle the spirits for the captured soul of a sick person. Thirty years or so of books on shamanism and trance workshops have made such visions and journeys sound almost ordinary to modern people. At the same time, those of us who grew up in mainstream Western religious traditions may assume that our own culture contains no such trance climbs up a tree or a ladder. In fact, the Bible contains several such images. Most obviously, there is the Tree of Life itself, from the Garden of Eden, and we will look closely at just what this story tells us in a mo- ment. But there also exists an image of a ladder that reaches from heaven to earth. <br> <br>In the book of Genesis, Jacob has fled his brother's anger and is traveling in the wilderness. At night, in a place called Luz, he sets some stones for a pillow and goes to sleep. Now, stones set into a pile are themselves an image of the heavenly ascent, which is one reason why we find sacred pyramids in Egypt, Babylon, and Mexico, and why people in the Stone Age created mounds and giant hills so large they seem part of the natural landscape. Asleep, Jacob has "a vision in a dream." He sees a ladder set on the ground, reaching up all the way to heaven. Angels-the original Hebrew word means "messengers," for angels are messengers of the divine- ascend and descend. The power of the world above-the "kingdom of God," as a much later prophet, Jesus of Nazareth, son of Mary, called it- moves freely between the exalted existence of the divine and the difficult world of mortals. <br> <br>Notice that the angels do not just descend from their realm to ours. Instead, they move in both directions, for if you have a ladder it does not go in only one direction.This, in fact, is a basic principle of esoteric ideas in general, and the Tree of Life in particular, that existence goes in both directions, from spirit "down" into physical matter, and from matter "up" into spirit. Neither is actually superior, for a full existence depends on both of them and the interchange between them. To really understand who we are we need to recognize that we, too, contain both spirit and matter, and that these qualities actually move up and down each other. When Watson, Crick,Wilkins, and Franklin discovered the double-spiral structure of DNA, the genetic basis of life, occultists recognized this as the same image found in spiritual teachings. <br> <br>We might understand this double-spiral movement a little better if we think of the creative process in humans. And here we have an excellent example in Hermann Haindl himself. Haindl is the epitome of what we could call an intuitive artist. He will often begin a work by letting paint splash on the canvas and seeing what pictures seem to emerge.We should not make the mistake, however, of thinking he acts without thought. From this instinctive response he moves to a highly conceptual work in which his life experiences, political beliefs, and sacred knowledge all combine to form a coherent whole.We might say, therefore, that an original image "descends" down the tree or ladder into physical reality on the canvas. The act of painting, and the thought that goes into it, then "ascends" into a work of art that is as intellectual as it is visual. <br> <br>In the Genesis story, Jacob does not himself travel up the ladder. Unlike the shamans, he does not ascend. In a sense, there is really no need, for in the next moment, God actually appears and speaks to Jacob directly, saying that Jacob's sons will become a great nation. When Jacob wakes up he names the place Beth-el, the "house of God," and calls it the "gate" of heaven for, he says,"God was in this place and I did not know it."These ideas, especially the gate, are also part of the shamanic, and later Kabbalist, idea of the tree, or ladder, that reaches to the realm of the divine. The Tree of Life is the path by which we climb to the sacred and then return to our true selves.Wherever and whenever we perceive it we find the gate of heaven. Jacob then marks the spot with yet another prehistoric image of the link between heaven and earth, a stone pillar. <br> <br>The shamans often climb the ladder or tree to struggle, even battle, the gods for the sake of helpless humans. Jacob only watches. But maybe he simply is not yet ready. Kabbalist tradition suggests that a man must not begin the study of Kabbalah until he has married and fathered children -in other words, until he has become mature and responsible. Only then can he face the powerful forces hidden within the study and practices of Kabbalah. (These traditions originated in a patriarchal culture that only rarely recognized the possibility for women to enter into them. As with so much else, the introduction of women's points of view has radically opened new ideas and approaches to the Tree of Life and other aspects of Kabbalah.) Jacob, too,must become the master of his own life before he can go further in his knowledge of the divine. <br> <br>Years after his dream vision, after he has married and begun his family, Jacob must once again confront his twin brother, with whom he has wrestled all his life, from their first moments in their mother's womb. Once more he sleeps in the wilderness, far from human civilization, with all its safety nets of assumed reality.This, too, is a shamanic experience, to find the sacred outside everyday life. Now, instead of a vision of powers that travel up and down a ladder, Jacob encounters a single figure, a "stranger" whose face he cannot quite see.And all night the two wrestle, neither one able to defeat the other. <br> <br>Tradition identifies this figure as an angel but that is not what the text actually says.When Jacob demands a blessing from the mysterious figure, the stranger gives him a new name (another common shamanic experience), Isra-el, "one who has wrestled with God." Jacob then names the place Peni-el, the "face of God," for he says,"I have seen God face to face and survived." And having done this, Jacob finds the courage to go to his brother and seek peace. <br> <br>As shamanic as this story is, it also is deeply Kabbalist.Though the ultimate truth of God lies beyond even the Tree of Life, the teachers identified aspects of the tree as a "greater" and "lesser face," and one goal of the study and meditation on the ten sephiroth becomes the ability to see those divine faces-and, like Jacob, survive the experience and then go on to seek peace. Jewish Kabbalists actually identify the "lesser face" as the central sephirah, Tiferet, which they also identify with Jacob, as the image of the perfect man; Christian Kabbalists see this sephirah as Christ. With his two visions, the ladder and the struggle, Jacob embodies the very qualities of those shamans who use poles, ladders, pillars, and living trees as vehicles to ascend to the heavenly world and claim humanity's place among the divine. For this reason, another name for the Tree of Life, with its ten lights and tw enty-two pathways, is Jacob's ladder. The Tree of Life diagram developed over many centuries, beginning in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and continuing to the late nineteenth century. Its origins-the roots of the tree,we might say-go back to the beginning of the Common Era (the term non-Christians use for the last two thousand years to avoid anno domini,"year of our lord"), with a remarkable work called the Sefer Yetsirah, the Book of Formation. In this very short text the anonymous writer first describes the sephiroth, the ten emanations of divine light, and the mystical power of the twentytwo Hebrew letters.The actual tree will be many centuries off, but this is where it began. <br> <br>We will look at the Sefer Yetsirah more closely, but it is worth considering a religious mystical movement going on at that time in ancient Judaea for what it tells us about the origins of Kabbalah and its goals, and therefore for ways we can approach the Tree of Life, both in its diagram form and in Her mann Haindl's remarkable painting. Two thousand y ears ago, right around the time of the teachings of Jesus, Judaism faced a great crisis. Rome was trying to crush the Jewish desire to follow its own traditions, and in the year 70, in response to Jewish rebellion, the Roman army destroyed the vast Temple of Solomon that had stood as the center of Jewish ritual and spiritual life for hundreds of years. <br> <br>Without the temple, and its seasonal rituals and sacrifices, how would people join themselves to God? The Sefer Yetsirah was, in fact, one answer, and it began a strain in mystical religion called "the work of creation," that is, the contemplation of the origins and structure of existence. Through meditation on the wonders of the sephiroth and the letters, and their place in the creation of the world, the mystic comes to a sense of the divine power that fills all existence, especially our own lives. Another response was a kind of shamanic revival called "the work of the merkavah," or the work of the chariot.The chariot refers to a mystic vision described in the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel lived during the Babylonian Exile, after the destruction of the first temple (Rome actually destroyed a second temple, rebuilt after the return from Babylon). His experience was therefore meaningful to those going through the pain of Roman attacks.The prophet described a highly detailed vision he had of a heavenly chariot, wheels within wheels and winged creatures with four faces. The merkavah mystics used this vision as their own vehicle for trance journeys into the seven hekhaloth (palaces) of heaven.The purpose of these journeys was to see the divine face to face, the very experience Jacob describes after his night of wrestling. <br> <br>The great detail of the merkavah writings show that the journeyers considered the hekhaloth real places and not just hallucinations or subjective images.They warn of improper responses one might make at certain points in the journey. At the same time they recognized that all this took place on an inner level, stimulated by meditation and magical practices, for they described the experience as a "descent" to the chariot, even as the traveler ascended to the palaces. The chariot was inside the self as well as in the heavenly realms. <br> <br>Because the tree uses the ten sephiroth and the twenty-two pathways we naturally think of it as derived from the Sefer Yetsirah and the work of creation. And of course it is, not just because of its structure but because of its tradition of contemplating the wonders of existence. But it also derives from the work of the chariot, for the tree is a vehicle as much as a thing of wonder.We use it not just to understand how life exists, or even how to understand divine laws;we use it to understand ourselves. And we use it to move ourselves through the journey of the pathways, step by step, until we discover our own vision, as much as we are able, of divine truth. And it is the special wonder of Hermann Haindl's painting that he shows this vehicle to be one truly of life and not just abstract thought. <br> <br>When Haindl writes on his painting "der baum ist der baum ist der baum ist der baum" ("The tree is the tree is the tree is the tree," reminiscent of Gertrude Stein's legendary poem "A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose"), he returns the philosophical concept to its literal roots. Around the world we find the Tree of Life seen as an actual tree, alive in the world. In the West we have lost our connections to nature as a divine revelation so that we tend to think of spiritual ideas as apart from the living world.We even may see the two as opposed, with anything physical being temporary and ultimately empty, while the spiritual becomes the thought that transcends nature.The Haindl tree, however, reminds us that we exist in nature, and if we cannot find the divine in living things then perhaps we will find it nowhere. <br> <br>In Africa and many other places, trees with white sap have signified the Mother Goddess, for they give "milk" yet, unlike short-lived humans, they remain strong and graceful over many decades, even centuries. Ancient Egypt identified the sycamore with the goddesses Nut (of the night sky, possibly the oldest goddess), Hathor (identified with the cow goddess), and Isis, founder of civilization, bringer of Osiris back from the dead. Osiris himself becomes embedded in a tree at one point of his story. His brother Set imprisons him in a jeweled coffin and floats him away down the Nile. The coffin drifts out to sea and lands at a place called Byblos, where a tree grows up around ...</p><h2>The Genesis of Secrecy: On the Interpretation of Narrative (The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures)</h2><p><p>Frank Kermode has long held a distinctive place among modern critics. He brings to the study of literature a fine and fresh critical intelligence that is always richly suggestive, never modish. He offers here an inquiry&#x2015;elegant in conception and style&#x2015;into the art of interpretation. His subject quite simply is meanings; how they are revealed and how they are concealed.</p><p>Drawing on the venerable tradition of biblical interpretation, Mr. Kermode examines some enigmatic passages and episodes in the gospels. From his reading come ideas about what makes interpretation possible&#x2015;and often impossible. He considers ways in which narratives acquire opacity, and he asks whether there are methods of distinguishing all possible meaning from a central meaning which gives the story its structure. He raises questions concerning the interpretation of single texts in relation to their context in a writer&#x2019;s work and a tradition; considers the special interpretative problems of historical narration; and tries to relate the activities of the interpreter to interpretation more broadly conceived as a means of living in the world.</p><p>While discussing the gospels, Mr. Kermode touches upon such literary works as Kafka&#x2019;s parables, Joyce&#x2019;s <i>Ulysses</i>, Henry James&#x2019;s novels, and Pynchon&#x2019;s <i>Crying of Lot 49</i>. By showing the relationships between religious interpretation and literary criticism, he has enhanced both fields.</p></p><p>Sir (John) Frank Kermode was Julian Clarence Levi Professor of English Literature, Emeritus, at Columbia University and a Fellow of King&#x2019;s College, University of Cambridge. He was instrumental in the 1979 founding of the <i>London Review of Books</i> and was knighted in 1991 for his service to literature.&#x201c;Of all his books, [this is] the one that sheds the fullest light on his critical ideals and philosophy, and was also the most ambitious and controversial... Kermode&#x2019;s insight was that interpretation is always a way of telling a new story. The comparison of secular and sacred interpretation of narrative was shocking to many... The importance of <i>The Genesis of Secrecy</i> is that it expresses Kermode&#x2019;s profound distrust of any system of reading that is coercive.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Charles Rosen</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Genesis of Secrecy</i> is important partly because of its method and partly because of its subject matter.

And the method is a disarming and delicate blend of the best work done recently in narrative theory by semiotic and post-structuralist critics, fortified by an impressive but unobtrusive acquaintance with biblical scholarship and hermeneutics.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Washington Post Book World</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The thesis is well wrought, the scholarship varied and well-distributed, and the examples clear and deft.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></p><h2>Stranger Than Science</h2><p>Readers will be baffled by this collection of astounding true stories of strange events, weird happenings, and unusual discoveries that science cannot explain.

The story concerns Tom, who traps a leprechaun into telling him where his pot of gold is buriedunder a bush in a field full of yellow-flowered weeds (the boliauns). Going off to get a spade, Tom marks the spot with a red garter, and returns to find a field full of red-gartered boliauns. Shute moves the story along briskly, illustrating it with full-page paintings in pastel shades, Tom and the leprechaun being drawn to typeor archetype. Also included is a two-page compilation of leprechaun folklore which is almost more interesting than the story itself. The narrative, pared down from the lilting language used in collections meant for older readers, loses much of its style, although Shute attempts to retain some inflections in the dialogue. Still, for picture book readers, this is an effective retelling, true to its sources in story and illustration, entertaining in its result.

Kaczynski&#39;s education at Harvard, the prevalence there of certain moral ideas common during the Cold War, his participation at Harvard in controversial psychological tests and experiments, and the impact of these tests on his psyche are important themes. Annotation (c) Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p><b>Alston Chase</b> lives in Livingston, Montana.Chase adds an important element to our understanding of the infamous Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. Part of what made Kaczynski an iconic figure after his arrest in 1996 for 16 mail bombings (resulting in three deaths) between 1978 and 1995 was his unusual background as a highly gifted, Harvard-educated mathematician. While the media found comfort in writing him off as a mental case, more remarkable was how seemingly typical Kaczynski was. Bucking the conventional wisdom, Chase (In a Dark Wood) identifies Kaczynski as a victim more of the anxious and contradictory Cold War 1950s than of the incendiary 1960s. With a background strikingly similar to Kaczynski's-including both a Harvard degree and self-imposed exile in Montana-Chase is in a unique position to probe the underlying tensions that led Kaczynski to commit dispassionate murder in the name of ideals. Chase persuasively isolates the turning point in his subject's years at Harvard, "where lasting human relations are more rare than championship football teams." In Cambridge he faced the typical Harvard pressures but, more importantly, was a subject of three years' worth of what many will agree were wildly irresponsible psychological experiments led by maverick psychology pioneer Henry A. Murray. While the conclusions Chase draws are unimpeachable, his description of the fateful experiments feels truncated, no doubt because some records remain sealed. Chase's disenchanted indictment of academia (represented here by Harvard) as lackey to the military-industrial complex is all the more compelling for the author's unruffled sense of perspective. With its unusual emphasis and sometimes surprisingly personal tone, this may become the definitive Kaczynski volume. 16 pages of photos not seen by PW.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kawase Hasui: The Complete Woodblock Prints</h2><p>Kawase Hasui (1883-1957) is considered the foremost Japanese landscape print artist of the 20th century.

Aggressive, self-reliant, and secretive by nature, they exist apart from civilians, having little contact with members of the other classes except when they need to feed.

The Reverend only trafficked in the best, but maybe she was a model for FHM or Maxim.</p><p>She planted her hands on the marble tabletop and leaned in toward him.

In this creatively argued follow-up to their book <i>The End of Capitalism (As We Knew It),</i> J. K. Gibson-Graham offer already existing alternatives to a global capitalist order and outline strategies for building alternative economies. <br><br><i>A Postcapitalist Politics</i> reveals a prolific landscape of economic diversity&#x2014;one that is not exclusively or predominantly capitalist&#x2014;and examines the challenges and successes of alternative economic interventions. Gibson-Graham bring together political economy, feminist poststructuralism, and economic activism to foreground the ethical decisions, as opposed to structural imperatives, that construct economic &#x201c;development&#x201d; pathways. Marshalling empirical evidence from local economic projects and action research in the United States, Australia, and Asia, they produce a distinctive political imaginary with three intersecting moments: a politics of language, of the subject, and of collective action. In the face of an almost universal sense of surrender to capitalist globalization, this book demonstrates that postcapitalist subjects, economies, and communities can be fostered. The authors describe a politics of possibility that can build different economies in place and over space. They urge us to confront the forces that stand in the way of economic experimentation and to explore different ways of moving from theory to action. <br><br>J. K.

With uncommon reasonableness, they share the principles and practices necessary to help your children stay in touch with your guidance and to support them through challenges you can't help them with. The comprehensive approach includes marvelous examples of respectful communication, as well as technical advice on wills, loans, and other financial matters. The program is balanced, and both the abridgment and narration make the ideas flow without any hitches.

In Dr. Kaku&#x2019;s eyes, we are living in a golden age of physics, as new discoveries from the WMAP and COBE satellites and the Hubble space telescope have given us unprecedented pictures of our universe in its infancy.<br><br>As astronomers wade through the avalanche of data from the WMAP satellite, a new cosmological picture is emerging. So far, the leading theory about the birth of the universe is the &#x201c;inflationary universe theory,&#x201d; a major refinement on the big bang theory. In this theory, our universe may be but one in a multiverse, floating like a bubble in an infinite sea of bubble universes, with new universes being created all the time. A parallel universe may well hover a mere millimeter from our own. <br><br>The very idea of parallel universes and the string theory that can explain their existence was once viewed with suspicion by scientists, seen as the province of mystics, charlatans, and cranks. But today, physicists overwhelmingly support string-theory, and its latest iteration, M-theory, as it is this one theory that, if proven correct, would reconcile the four forces of the universe simply and elegantly, and answer the question &#x201c;What happened before the big bang?&#x201d;<br><br>Already, Kaku explains, the world&#x2019;s foremost physicists and astronomers are searching for ways to test the theory of the multiverse using highly sophisticated wave detectors, gravity lenses, satellites, and telescopes. The implications of M-theory are fascinating and endless. If parallel worlds do exist, Kaku speculates, in time, perhaps a trillion years or more from now, as appears likely, when our universe grows cold and dark in what scientists describe as a big freeze, advanced civilizations may well find a way to escape our universe in a kind of &#x201c;inter-dimensional lifeboat.&#x201d; <br><br>An unforgettable journey into black holes and time machines, alternate universes, and multidimensional space, <i>Parallel Worlds </i>gives us a compelling portrait of the revolution sweeping the world of cosmology.</p></p><p><p>In PARALLEL WORLDS, his first book of physics since <i>Hyperspace</i>, Michio Kaku describes the extraordinary advances that have transformed cosmology and remade our understanding of the universe. The startling discovery of a mysterious energy driving the universe to expand and scientists' attempts to reconcile the four faces of the universe have led to the development of the revolutionary M-theory. The leading candidate for Einstein's fabled "theory of everything," M-theory depicts our universe as a "bubble" floating in an expansive eleven-dimensional "multiverse." Leading physicists now envision our universe as one of countless "bubble universes" only millimeters away from each other. In this new picture, Big Bangs create new universes all the time and, if these parallel universes are as close as physicists believe, our universe could eventually collide with one of them&#x2014;with cosmic consequences. <br><br>Kaku deftly weaves lucid scientific explanations and engaging profiles of the physicists working in the field, with a compelling narrative of breakthroughs in physics, astronomy, and cosmology that have led to M-theory. If scientists' cosmological predictions are correct, time travel between these parallel universes is not only possible&#x2014;it may be the only way humankind, billions of years from now, can save itself from a dying universe.</p><p><b>MICHIO KAKU </b>is the Henry Semat Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

For a quarter of a century the KGB believed that the Third World was the arena in which it could win the Cold War. &#39;The world,&#39; claimed Moscow, &#39;was going our way.&#39; This book discloses the KGB&#39;s secret contacts with a series of world leaders, among them Castro, Allende, Nasser, Saddam Hussein and Mengistu, as well as with terrorist hijackers and communist parties around the globe. It also shows the enormous resources devoted, with varying degrees of success, to trying to determine the course of events in countries as different as India (the main force for KGB active measures in Asia) and Afghanistan (where the KGB took the lead in the Soviet invasion). The revelations range from the shocking to the absurd - Soviet agents assessing the spread of their great rival, Chinese communism, by counting the changing number of Mao Zedong posters in Africa - and take the story all the way to the disintegration of the Eastern Bloc.</p><p>Christopher Andrew is Professor of Modern and Contemporary History and Chair of the Faculty of History at Cambridge University.

The humor, the magic, and a lush Renaissance setting are all on glorious display, and a well-placed gatefold adds to the drama. This elegant new edition of Charles Perrault's folktale is essential for every child's library. Read it in tandem with other Pinkney classic picture books like <i>The Little Red Hen</i> and <i>The Lion and the Mouse.</i><br><br>"This book is larger than life."-<i>Library Media Connection</i></p><p>Jerry Pinkney is one of America's most admired children's book illustrators. He has won the Caldecott Medal and five Caldecott Honors, five Coretta Scott King Awards, five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Ten Best Illustrated Awards, the Coretta Scott King-Virginia Hamilton Award for Lifetime Achievement, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, and the Society of Illustrators' Original Art Show Lifetime Achievement Award, and many other prizes and honors.

Jerry Pinkney lives with his wife, author Gloria Jean Pinkney, in Westchester County, New York.PreS-Gr 4-Set in early-18th-century France, this adaptation of Charles Perrault's classic tale is filled with lushly delineated period details, moments of tingling excitement, and playful humor. The protagonist, a handsome silver-tabby British shorthair, boasts elegant black-velvet stripes and intelligent green eyes. Bequeathed to a miller's youngest son, the can-do cat promises that he will prove his worth if provided with appropriate footwear and a draw-string sack. Puss gets to work, cunningly using the sack to hunt game, courteously presenting his prizes to the king, and continually singing the praises of his master (dubbed the Count of Carabas). Cleverly orchestrating a meeting between the young man and the king's lovely daughter, Puss bamboozles the monarch into believing that Benjamin is a man of means and then procures these riches by tricking an evil sorcerer out of his holdings. The story ends with a royal wedding and Puss-now prime minister-contemplating future adventures (the rear endpaper shows him captaining a sailing ship). The text clearly relates the plot with lyrical language and vivacious energy, and the color-pencil and watercolor artwork showcases the period's costumes, architecture, and landscapes. Perfectly timed highpoints (and a foldout page) emphasize the sorcerer's transformations into various animals (in response to Puss's taunting dare), as well as the cat pouncing on the man-turned-helpless-mouse. Accessible and eye-catching, this is a fitting companion to Fred Marcellino's exquisite rendition (Farrar, 1990).-Joy Fleishhacker, School Library Journal&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

There is a &#34;disturbing contradiction&#34; in John&#39;s writings between his Ascent and Dark Night on the one hand, and Spiritual Canticle and Living Flame on the other. In the latter he seems to be saying that we should detach ourselves from crude consolations in order to enjoy something immensely superior, but &#34;I deliberately say &#39;seems&#39;. It is tempting to speculate, to advance theories for this apparently blatant inconsistency but that would not serve the purpose of this book. It is enough to remark that for the majority of readers the impression is such as I have given. If John is really saying what these people think he is then we are justified in disregarding him in given instances.</p><p></p><h2>Gardening for a Lifetime: How to Garden Wiser as You Grow Older</h2><p><b>From the winner of the National Garden Club's Award of Excellence</b><br><br> Although the garden may beckon as strongly as ever, the tasks involved&#x2014;pulling weeds, pushing wheelbarrows, digging holes, moving heavy pots&#x2014;become increasingly difficult, or even impossible, with advancing age. But the idea of giving it up is unthinkable for most gardeners. So what&#x2019;s the alternative?<br><br> In <i>Gardening for a Lifetime</i>, Sydney Eddison draws on her own forty years of gardening to provide a practical and encouraging roadmap for scaling back while keeping up with the gardening activities that each gardener loves most. Like replacing demanding plants like delphiniums with sturdy, relatively carefree perennials like sedums, rudbeckias, and daylilies. Or taking the leap and hiring help&#x2014;another pair of hands, even for a few hours a week, goes a long way toward getting a big job done.<br><br> This new edition features an additional&nbsp;chapter describing how Sydney&#x2019;s struggles with hip and back problems forced her to walk the walk.

And while many of the practices described are ideal for older gardeners, they also have much to offer younger gardeners with demanding professional or family responsibilities.<br><br> This new edition offers a brand new chapter, bringing readers up to date about the ongoing changes in the author's garden and life.&nbsp;Sydney Eddison has written six other books on gardening.

For thousands of years these myths have inspired plays, operas, paintings, movies, and television programs. They are fascinating tales that tell us about ourselves&#x20ac;&#x201d;about our hopes, fears, and desires, which are as ancient as mankind. Many of these myths are deeply disturbing; others are sublimely beautiful. All of them move us still, as they did the Greeks and Romans hundreds of generations ago. Oh My Gods is a retelling of some of the most popular myths by a gifted scholar and writer. These tales of errant gods, fantastic creatures, and human heroes are brought to life in fresh and contemporary versions.

Three of the sons they raised in Argos were Alcaeus, Electryon, and Sthenelus. In time Alcaeus grew up and had a son of his own named Amphitryon, while Electryon had nine sons and a daughter he named Alcmene.<br> <br>When Perseus died, Electryon became king of Mycenae. The coast of Argos in those days was plagued by pirates and one day they attacked Electryon&#x2019;s sons while they were tending cattle. Unfortunately for the princes, they were no match for the raiders. The king himself then decided to seek revenge on the pirates for their crime. He entrusted Mycenae to his nephew Amphitryon as regent along with the care of his daughter&#x2014;but gave him a stern warning that her virtue had better be intact when he returned. Nephew and uncle then quarreled, with words leading to drawn swords. In the passion of the moment, Amphitryon slew Electryon.<br> <br>Electryon&#x2019;s brother Sthenelus took the throne and banished Amphitryon from the kingdom. Alcmene willingly accompanied him into exile and the two made their way north to the city of Thebes, where King Creon purified Amphitryon of blood guilt from the slaying of his uncle. Amphitryon was now eager to marry Alcmene and enjoy the pleasures of her bed, but his beautiful cousin had other ideas. Yes, she would gladly marry him, but&#x2014;as a matter of honor&#x2014;he first had to hunt down the pirates who had killed her brothers. Amphitryon was only too happy to seek vengeance against the men who had murdered his cousins, but he was also eager to make love to his new wife. Thus with great urgency, he collected together a band of warriors and set off to destroy the pirates.<br> <br>Amphitryon was successful, but on the night of his return, Zeus took on his appearance and entered the chamber of Alcmene disguised as her husband. The god showed his bride trophies of his victory over the pirates and said it was time at last for a real honeymoon. Zeus lengthened the night to three times its normal length as he made love to Alcmene again and again.<br> <br>No sooner had the god left than the real Amphitryon entered the palace. He ran upstairs to Alcmene&#x2019;s bedroom and embraced his wife at last. The exhausted Alcmene couldn&#x2019;t understand how her husband still had such energy after the long night of passion they had already enjoyed. When dawn came, the poor woman asked why he had come to her twice in a single night as if it were the first time. Amphitryon was furious, so he decided to seek out Tiresias the prophet to discover who had slept with Alcmene before him. The seer revealed that it was in fact Zeus who had shared her bed. Amphitryon was none too pleased with this news, but he could hardly blame his wife for the amorous encounter and it was pointless to rage against the god. Reluctantly he accepted the fact that both he and Zeus had enjoyed her favors that night.<br> <br>Hera was angry as always that Zeus had cheated on her. She determined to make Alcmene and her child pay for the philandering of her husband. The goddess was even more eager to do this when after nine months Zeus rose from his throne on Olympus and declared that the fruit of his loins born that day would rule over the fertile plain of Argos. Hera made him swear that this would be so, then she slipped away and sped down to Mycenae, where the young wife of Sthenelus was seven months pregnant. The goddess caused her to go into early labor so that her son would be born first in fulfillment of the prophesy instead of Alcmene&#x2019;s. As Sthenelus was the grandson of Zeus, his son was also the offspring of Hera&#x2019;s husband and could fulfill the prophecy.<br> <br>Meanwhile, to buy time until the wife of Sthenelus gave birth, Hera had sent Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to wait outside the bedchamber of Alcmene. Instead of easing her delivery, Eileithyia sat with her legs and fingers tightly crossed in an act of sympathetic magic to prolong her labor. The screams of Alcmene went on for many hours as the pain increased. At last one of her servants, a clever old woman named Galanthis, noticed the stranger in the shadows and understood what this mysterious figure was doing. Galanthis then shouted, &#x201c;Rejoice, a child is born! Alcmene has given birth!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Impossible,&#x201d; cried out Eileithyia, but the distraction was enough to break her concentration and end the spell. Eileithyia was so angry at the trick that she immediately turned the old woman into a weasel. The long-suffering Alcmene then at last gave birth not to one but two sons. One was Iphicles, fathered by the mortal Amphitryon, but the other was sired on the same night by Zeus. His name was Hercules.<br> <br>After Hercules was born, his mother Alcmene was afraid that Hera would kill her just as she had so many of Zeus&#x2019; lovers. She therefore took her baby and left him to die in a deserted field, hoping that this would satisfy the vengeance of the goddess. By no coincidence, Athena happened upon the infant and took him to Mount Olympus. She brought him to Hera and asked if she would nurse the beautiful baby she had found. Hera did not know who the boy was and always had a soft spot for children, so she gladly agreed and put the child to her breast. All went well until the precociously strong Hercules bit his divine nursemaid hard on the nipple. Hera screamed in pain and jumped up, spurting milk everywhere. Athena then took the child back to his mother in Thebes and persuaded her to raise him. Hera&#x2019;s milk meanwhile spread across the heavens and came to be known as the Milky Way.<br> <br>Hercules was just a few months old when Hera first tried to kill him. He was in his crib with his brother, Iphicles, one night when the goddess sent two large and poisonous serpents into their room. The snakes silently moved across the floor until they came to the bed, then climbed up until they were on top of the babies. Iphicles awoke and screamed, but Hercules grabbed a serpent in each of his chubby hands and squeezed. Alcmene and Amphitryon rushed in to find baby Hercules laughing as he held two dead snakes by the neck.<br> <br>From his earliest days Hercules excelled in physical activities, especially since his teachers were the best Greece had to offer. His mortal father, Amphitryon, taught him to drive a chariot, while a king named Eurytus instructed him in the use of the bow. Helen&#x2019;s brother Castor taught him to fight with a sword and Hermes&#x2019; son Harpalycus showed him how to wrestle. Linus, the brother of Orpheus, tried to teach him to sing and play the lyre, but Hercules was a poor student of music. Linus grew so frustrated with his pupil that one day he boxed him on the ears. Hercules flew into a rage and smashed the lyre on top of his teacher&#x2019;s head, killing him. Young Hercules was put on trial for murder, but argued that by ancient custom a man was allowed to kill anyone who struck him first. The judges were impressed by this clever youth and acquitted him of all charges.<br> <br>Amphitryon then wisely decided he should send Hercules out into the country to vent his energy doing chores on a farm. The boy loved this rural life and outdid all of his companions in performing farm tasks and hunting in the woods. By the time he was a young man, he was taller by a head than all his fellows and his eyes gleamed with fire. No one could beat him in contests of skill, whether shooting arrows or throwing the javelin.<br> <br>When Hercules was eighteen, word reached him that an enormous lion was ravaging the flocks of King Thespius on nearby Mount Cithaeron. The beast was very hard to track, so Hercules spent fifty nights in the home of Thespius while he hunted. The king was so impressed by this young man that he decided he wanted each of his fifty daughters to bear his child. Hercules was potent but not very bright. Every night while he stayed with the king, a different girl slipped into his dark bedroom. Hercules&#x2014;thinking that it was the same young woman each time coming back for more&#x2014;gladly made love with each one. Some stories even say that Thespius got Hercules drunk and sent in all fifty daughters at once. But whether in a single night or over a period of weeks, Hercules impregnated each girl. Somehow he also found time to kill the lion.<br> <br>In the days when young Hercules lived in the city, Thebes was dominated by the Minyans to the north. The king of the Minyans was Erginus, who ruled at Orchomenus and demanded that each year the Thebans send him a hundred of their best cattle. As Hercules was returning home after he had killed the lion of Mount Cithaeron, he happened to meet the Minyan heralds on their way to Thebes to collect their annual tribute. Hercules was so incensed by this humiliation of his town that he cut off the ears, noses, and hands of the heralds and sent them back to Orchomenus mutilated. King Erginus was furious at this outrageous insult and gathered his powerful army to march against Thebes. When he reached the walls of the city he demanded that Creon send out Hercules to be punished. The king of Thebes was seriously considering this when Hercules gathered the young men of the town and broke into a local temple. There the Thebans had long ago dedicated their weapons to the gods and hung them on a wall where they had gathered dust for years. With Hercules leading them, the youthful warriors took up the ancient arms and marched out against the Minyans. The band of Thebans not only slew Erginus and killed almost everyone in the Minyan army, but they also proceeded to the capital of their enemy and burned Orchomenus to the ground. Thanks to Hercules, the Thebans were now free.<br> <br>Creon was so grateful to Hercules that he gave him his own daughter Megara to be his bride. The young couple lived happily together and had three sons, but Hera had not forgotten her anger against Hercules and was not about to let this happy domestic scene continue. She whispered in the ear of Hercules that he was nothing, a nobody from a small town who was a grave disappointment to his divine father. A true son of Zeus would have accomplished more than kill a mangy lion and defeat the Minyan rabble in a minor war. In visions of the night and in his darkest thoughts, she told him he was no hero.<br> <br>Hercules wanted to be so much more than a husband and father. Hearth and home had their rewards, but he longed for danger and adventure to prove himself. The conflict between his dreams and the responsibilities of family life caused him such frustration that he didn&#x2019;t know which way to turn. Hera fanned this frenzy until at last Hercules lost his mind.<br> <br>One day he was performing a sacrifice to the gods with his wife and sons in attendance. His beautiful young children looked up at him in silent reverence as he carried the sacred basket of barley around the altar. Hercules stood ready to quench the flame of the altar torch in a basin so that he could sprinkle the holy water on his family as a blessing. Suddenly, without a word, he froze. Megara and the children stared at him wondering what was wrong. His bloodshot eyes rolled wildly in his head, drool dribbled into his beard, and then he screamed out with manic laughter: &#x201c;Why should I sacrifice before I slay Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, king of Mycenae? I&#x2019;ll kill that miserable usurper with a single blow. Throw away the basket, pour out the water, and someone get my bow! I&#x2019;m off to Mycenae. I&#x2019;ll knock down those mighty walls with my bare hands.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hercules grabbed his bow and club, then climbed into an imaginary chariot and whipped invisible horses to a gallop. His servants didn&#x2019;t know if he had gone insane or if this were some kind of joke. Their master cried out that he was crossing the Isthmus of Corinth and was nearing his goal. He then jumped on the ground and began running around the altar looking for his enemies. His children were now terrified and cried out, catching the attention of their father. He drew his bow on his eldest son, thinking he was a child of Eurystheus.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; cried Megara as she threw herself in front of her son. &#x201c;You gave this child life. Will you now take it away?&#x201d;<br> <br>But Hercules was in a world of his own and could not hear her. He chased the boy around the yard and caught him at last, then stabbed him through the heart with the sacrificial knife. The blood of the young child spurted from his small body as he collapsed into his mother&#x2019;s arms.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of your brood, Eurystheus,&#x201d; cried Hercules. &#x201c;Now for the rest!&#x201d;<br> <br>His second son tried to hide behind the altar, but his father found him there and dragged him away. As Hercules raised his club to crush his head, the boy grasped his father&#x2019;s knees and begged him, &#x201c;Daddy, please, don&#x2019;t kill me! I&#x2019;m your own little boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>But like a blacksmith at the forge, Hercules brought down his club on the boy&#x2019;s fair hair and crushed his skull.<br> <br>Megara grabbed her last child and ran into their house, barring the door. But Hercules burst through and drew his bow on mother and child crouched in the corner. Without a word, he shot them both through with a single arrow.<br> <br>He would have killed everyone present, but Athena suddenly appeared before him and tossed a huge stone at his chest, knocking the breath from his body and driving away Hera&#x2019;s madness. Hercules slowly rose from the ground and gazed in horror at the scene before him. Then he sank to his knees and wept.<br> <br>For weeks Hercules was beyond consolation. He had murdered his own wife and children&#x2014;madness or not, he could not forgive himself. Friends and family came to sit with him, but he wanted nothing to do with anyone. His grief consumed him until he was a shell of his former self.<br> <br>Although time cannot heal all wounds, as the months passed Hercules realized he would have to move on or die alone in a dark and empty house. At last he roused himself and left Thebes behind to seek the counsel of the oracle at Delphi. He made his way west over the mountains until he came to the temple of Apollo beneath Mount Parnassus. Sacrifices performed, he entered the sanctuary and asked the priestess what he must do to be healed of his pain and find forgiveness. The message she gave him was not pleasing. He must return to his ancestral home in Argos and there serve his young uncle Eurystheus, performing whatever twelve labors this hated king would assign him. This was a bitter pill for Hercules to swallow and a powerful lesson in humility. Not only would he be reduced to the level of a slave, but his master would be the very man who had stolen the rightful throne of Argos from him. Still, there was nothing he could do except follow the will of the god. He left the slopes of Parnassus and walked slowly down the road to Argos.<br> <br>The cowardly Eurystheus was terrified when he heard that Hercules was on his way to Mycenae. He thought that his nephew was planning to kill him and steal the throne. As Hercules entered the massive gates of the citadel with stone lions on each side, Eurystheus hid himself in a large bronze jar buried in the ground and hoped that his nephew wouldn&#x2019;t find him. But Hercules marched into the palace grounds and tore the lid off the jar, hauling Eurystheus to his feet. The king begged for mercy with his hands raised in supplication, but finally calmed down when Hercules explained his mission. The ruler of Argos then determined to assign his nephew the most dangerous tasks he could think of, hoping that he would be killed quickly and never enter Mycenae again.<br> <br>Seated on his throne but still shaking, Eurystheus commanded Hercules to seek out and slay a great lion that was ravaging the country around Nemea, to the north of Mycenae. Hercules did not think this first labor would be difficult. He had already killed a fierce lion on Mount Cithaeron and supposed this animal would be no ...</p><h2>POSSESSION</h2><p>Physical description; 511 pages ; 25 cm.

Together with Roland Michell, a fellow academic and accidental sleuth, Maud discovers a love affair between the two Victorian writers the pair has dedicated their lives to studying: Randolph Ash, a literary great long assumed to be a devoted and faithful husband, and Christabel La Motte, a lesser-known "fairy poetess" and chaste spinster. At first, Roland and Maud's discovery threatens only to alter the direction of their research, but as they unearth the truth about the long-forgotten romance, their involvement becomes increasingly urgent and personal. Desperately concealing their purpose from competing researchers, they embark on a journey that pulls each of them from solitude and loneliness, challenges the most basic assumptions they hold about themselves, and uncovers their unique entitlement to the secret of Ash and La Motte's passion. <p> Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize--the U.K.'s highest literary award--<i>Possession</i> is a gripping and compulsively readable novel.

The bedside table is home to read before-bed-but-not-on-the-subway books (heavy hardcovers like Hilary Mantel's <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em>), mysteries/thrillers (like Robert Wilson's <em>A Small Death in Lisbon</em>) and things I ought to read but are slooow going (I am now on my fifth month with Augustine's <em>The City of God</em>).</p> <p><strong>Q.

Book that changed your life (or book that made you want to become a writer)?</strong></p> <p>A. I wrote throughout my childhood and thought I wanted to be a poet, but that was more a fantasy than a goal. I was 15 when someone gave me Sonia Sanchez's<em>, I've Been a Woman</em>&#x2014;that book was a revolution in my life. I realized that I actually could be a poet, that there were black women who were writing--right then, in that moment.</p> <p><strong>Q. Memorable author moment?</strong></p> <p>A. This one?

What are you currently stressed about or psyched about?</strong></p> <p>A. I'm psyched about writing some essays on the nature of faith and belief. Writing essays is a very different process from writing fiction. I'm having a hard time with them, which is incredibly exhilarating and incredibly stressful.</p> <p><strong>Q.

He also served as primary editor of <i>Rolling Stone: The Seventies</i> and primary contributor to Rolling Stones Jazz &amp; Blues Album.*Starred Review* Coltrane was already a jazz colossus, acclaimed by peers, critics, and audiences alike, when he, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones recorded the spiritually informed four-part suite<i> A Love Supreme,</i> very efficiently and in sequence, on December 9, 1964, in recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder's New Jersey studio. After its release and much greater popularity than avant-garde jazz customarily enjoys, Coltrane became a spiritual as well as musical hero to every subsequent generation of jazz players and listeners. Here Kahn does for <i>A Love Supreme</i> what he did in <i>Kind of Blue: The Making of the Miles Davis Masterpiece</i> (2000) for Coltrane's former employer's biggest hit, and because <i>A Love Supreme</i> was pivotal in Coltrane's career--he became the fountainhead of free jazz almost immediately after recording it--Kahn winds up writing the great saxophonist's biography again, more lucidly, if in less detail, than anyone has before.

She discovers this gift to her horror, for her mother&#x2014;her cheerful, good-with-crafts, can-do mother&#x2014;tastes of despair and desperation. Suddenly, and for the rest of her life, food becomes a peril and a threat to Rose. <br><br>The curse her gift has bestowed is the secret knowledge all families keep hidden&#x2014;her mother&#x2019;s life outside the home, her father&#x2019;s detachment, her brother&#x2019;s clash with the world. Yet as Rose grows up she learns to harness her gift and becomes aware that there are secrets even her taste buds cannot discern. <br><br><i>The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake</i> is a luminous tale about the enormous difficulty of loving someone fully when you know too much about them. It is heartbreaking and funny, wise and sad, and confirms Aimee Bender&#x2019;s place as &#x201c;a writer who makes you grateful for the very existence of language&#x201d; (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>).</p><p>AIMEE BENDER is the author of the novel <i>An Invisible Sign of My Own</i> and the collections <i>The Girl in the Flammable Skirt </i>and <i>Willful Creatures</i>. She has received two Pushcart prizes and was nominated for the Tiptree Award in 2005.It happened for the first time on a Tuesday afternoon,<br>a warm spring day in the flatlands near Hollywood, a light<br>breeze moving east from the ocean and stirring the black- eyed<br>pansy petals newly planted in our flower boxes.<br>My mother was home, baking me a cake. When I tripped up<br>the walkway, she opened the front door before I could knock.<br>How about a practice round? she said, leaning past the door<br>frame. She pulled me in for a hello hug, pressing me close to my<br>favorite of her aprons, the worn cotton one trimmed in sketches<br>of twinned red cherries.<br>On the kitchen counter, she&#x2019;d set out the ingredients: Flour<br>bag, sugar box, two brown eggs nestled in the grooves between<br>tiles. A yellow block of butter blurring at the edges. A shallow<br>glass bowl of lemon peel. I toured the row. This was the week of<br>my ninth birthday, and it had been a long day at school of cursive<br>lessons, which I hated, and playground yelling about point<br>scoring, and the sunlit kitchen and my warm- eyed mother were<br>welcome arms, open. I dipped a finger into the wax baggie of<br>brown- sugar crystals, murmured yes, please, yes.<br>She said there was about an hour to go, so I pulled out my<br>1<br>spelling booklet. Can I help? I asked, spreading out pencils and<br>papers on the vinyl place mats.<br>Nah, said Mom, whisking the flour and baking soda<br>together.<br>My birthday is in March, and that year it fell during an<br>especially bright spring week, vivid and clear in the narrow residential<br>streets where we lived just a handful of blocks south of<br>Sunset. The night- blooming jasmine that crawled up our neighbor&#x2019;s<br>front gate released its heady scent at dusk, and to the north,<br>the hills rolled charmingly over the horizon, houses tucked into<br>the brown. Soon, daylight savings time would arrive, and even at<br>nearly nine, I associated my birthday with the first hint of summer,<br>with the feeling in classrooms of open windows and lighter<br>clothing and in a few months no more homework. My hair got<br>lighter in spring, from light brown to nearly blond, almost like<br>my mother&#x2019;s ponytail tassel. In the neighborhood gardens, the<br>agapanthus plants started to push out their long green robot<br>stems to open up to soft purples and blues.<br>Mom was stirring eggs; she was sifting flour. She had one<br>bowl of chocolate icing set aside, another with rainbow sprinkles.<br>A cake challenge like this wasn&#x2019;t a usual afternoon activity;<br>my mother didn&#x2019;t bake all that often, but what she enjoyed most<br>was anything tactile, and this cake was just one in a long line of<br>recent varied hands- on experiments. In the last six months, she&#x2019;d<br>coaxed a strawberry plant into a vine, stitched doilies from vintage<br>lace, and in a burst of motivation installed an oak side door<br>in my brother&#x2019;s bedroom with the help of a hired contractor.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been working as an office administrator, but she didn&#x2019;t<br>like copy machines, or work shoes, or computers, and when my<br>father paid off the last of his law school debt, she asked him if<br>she could take some time off and learn to do more with her<br>hands. My hands, she told him, in the hallway, leaning her hips<br>against his; my hands have had no lessons in anything.<br>Anything? he&#x2019;d asked, holding tight to those hands. She<br>laughed, low. Anything practical, she said.<br>They were right in the way, in the middle of the hall, as I<br>was leaping from room to room with a plastic leopard. Excuse<br>me, I said.<br>He breathed in her hair, the sweet- smelling thickness of it.<br>My father usually agreed with her requests, because stamped in<br>his two- footed stance and jaw was the word Provider, and he<br>loved her the way a bird- watcher&#x2019;s heart leaps when he hears the<br>call of the roseate spoonbill, a fluffy pink wader, calling its lilting<br>coo- coo from the mangroves. Check, says the bird- watcher.<br>Sure, said my father, tapping a handful of mail against her back.<br>Rah, said the leopard, heading back to its lair.<br>At the kitchen table, I flipped through my workbook, basking<br>in the clicking sounds of a warming oven. If I felt a hint of anything<br>unsettling, it was like the sun going swiftly behind a cloud<br>only to shine straight seconds later. I knew vaguely that my parents<br>had had an argument the night before, but parents had<br>arguments all the time, at home and on TV. Plus, I was still busily<br>going over the bad point scoring from lunch, called by Eddie<br>Oakley with the freckles, who never called fairly. I read through<br>my spelling booklet: knack, knick, knot; cartwheel, wheelbarrow,<br><br>wheelie. At the counter, Mom poured thick yellow batter into a<br>greased cake pan, and smoothed the top with the flat end of a<br>pink plastic spatula. She checked the oven temperature, brushed<br>a sweaty strand of hair off her forehead with the knob of her<br>wrist.<br>Here we go, she said, slipping the cake pan into the oven.<br>When I looked up, she was rubbing her eyelids with the pads<br>of her fingertips. She blew me a kiss and said she was going to lie<br>down for a little bit. Okay, I nodded. Two birds bickered outside.<br>In my booklet, I picked the person doing a cartwheel and colored<br>her shoes with red laces, her face a light orange. I made a<br>vow to bounce the ball harder on the playground, and to bounce<br>it right into Eddie Oakley&#x2019;s corner. I added some apples to the<br>wheelbarrow freehand.<br>The room filled with the smell of warming butter and sugar<br>and lemon and eggs, and at five, the timer buzzed and I pulled<br>out the cake and placed it on the stovetop. The house was quiet.<br>The bowl of icing was right there on the counter, ready to go,<br>and cakes are best when just out of the oven, and I really<br>couldn&#x2019;t possibly wait, so I reached to the side of the cake pan,<br>to the least obvious part, and pulled off a small warm spongy<br>chunk of deep gold. Iced it all over with chocolate. Popped the<br>whole thing into my mouth.</p><h2>Small Is the New Big: and 183 Other Riffs, Rants, and Remarkable Business Ideas</h2><p>As one of today&#x2019;s most influential business thinkers, Seth Godin helps his army of fans stay focused, stay connected, and stay dissatisfied with the status quo, the ordinary, the boring.

John MacArthur has successfully written a concise yet complete account of the gospel message in <i>I Believe in Jesus</i>, written entirely for young minds and hearts. With stirring watercolor illustrations from Melinda MacArthur, the author's daughter, <i>I Believe in Jesus</i> will hold the attention of little ones as well as communicate the most important message they will ever hear. Beginning at creation and moving through to eternity, MacArthur speaks directly to children in simple language by bringing theology (even tough subjects like the trinity) to a basic level. Pointed questions that ask, "Have you ever noticed how hard it is to always be good, kind, loving, and unselfish?" point out the child's need for a savior, while insightful answers give hope to young readers, saying, "Our sins should keep us out of heaven, but instead, God invites everyone--you too!--to come to Him and ask for forgiveness for our sins." As the child matures, he or she will begin to understand the Word of God in accordance with the childlike explanation coupled with it. This is sure to bring understanding that leads to wisdom (and hopefully repentance!) rather than the knowledge of a good story. The Word of God is trusted in this short story to change the hearts of children, hoping to usher them into His kingdom at a young, blessed age. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>JOHN F.

He died in 1961.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>They started two hours before daylight, and at first, it was not necessary to break the ice across the canal as other boats had gone on ahead. In each boat, in the darkness, so you could not see, but only hear him, the poler stood in the stern, with his long oar. The shooter sat on a shooting stool fastened to the top of a box that contained his lunch and shells, and the shooter's two, or more, guns were propped against the load of wooden decoys. Somewhere, in each boat, there was a sack with one or two live mallard hens, or a hen and a drake, and in each boat there was a dog who shifted and shivered uneasily at the sound of the wings of the ducks that passed overhead in the darkness.<br><br>Four of the boats went on up the main canal toward the big lagoon to the north. A fifth boat had already turned off into a side canal. Now, the sixth boat turned south into a shallow lagoon, and there was no broken water.<br><br>It was all ice, new-frozen during the sudden, windless cold of the night. It was rubbery and bending against the thrust of the boatman's oar. Then it would break as sharply as a pane of glass, but the boat made little forward progress.<br><br>"Give me an oar," the shooter in the sixth boat said. He stood up and braced himself carefully. He could hear the ducks passing in the darkness, and feel the restless lurching of the dog. To the north he heard the sound of breaking ice from the other boats.<br><br>"Be careful," the poler in the stern said. "Don't tip the boat over."<br><br>"I am a boatman, too," the shooter said.<br><br>He took the long oar the boatman handed him and reversed it so he could hold it by the blade. Holding the blade he reached forward and punched the handle through the ice. He felt the firm bottom of the shallow lagoon, put his weight on the top of the wide oar-blade, and holding with both hands and, first pulling, then shoving, until the pole-hold was well to the stern, he drove the boat ahead to break the ice. The ice broke like sheets of plate glass as the boat drove into it, and onto it, and astern the boatman shoved them ahead into the broken passage.<br><br>After a while, the shooter, who was working hard and steadily and sweating in his heavy clothes, asked the boatman, "Where is the shooting barrel?"<br><br>"Off there to the left. In the middle of the next bay."<br><br>"Should I turn for it now?"<br><br>"As you wish."<br><br>"What do you mean, as I wish? You know the water. Is there water to carry us there?"<br><br>"The tide is low. Who knows?"<br><br>"It will be daylight before we get there if we don't hurry."<br><br>The boatman did not answer.<br><br>All right, you surly jerk, the shooter thought to himself. We are going to get there. We've made two-thirds of the way now and if you are worried about having to work to break ice to pick up birds, that is altogether too bad.<br><br>"Get your back in it, jerk," he said in English.<br><br>"What?" the boatman asked in Italian.<br><br>"I said let's go. It's going to be light."<br><br>It was daylight before they reached the oaken staved hogshead sunk in the bottom of the lagoon. It was surrounded by a sloping rim of earth that had been planted with sedge and grass, and the shooter swung carefully up onto this, feeling the frozen grasses break as he stepped on them. The boatman lifted the combination shooting stool and shell box out of the boat and handed it to the shooter, who leaned over and placed it in the bottom of the big barrel.<br><br>The shooter, wearing his hip boots and an old combat jacket, with a patch on the left shoulder that no one understood, and with the slight light places on the straps, where stars had been removed, climbed down into the barrel and the boatman handed him his two guns.<br><br>He placed them against the wall of the barrel and hung his other shell bag between them, hanging it on two hooks built into the wall of the sunken barrel. Then he leaned the guns against each side of the shell bag.<br><br>"Is there water?" he asked the boatman.<br><br>"No water," the boatman said.<br><br>"Can you drink the lagoon water?"<br><br>"No. It is unhealthy."<br><br>The shooter was thirsty from the hard work of breaking the ice and driving the boat in and he felt his anger rise, and then held it, and said, "Can I help you in the boat to break ice to put out the decoys?"<br><br>"No," the boatman said and shoved the boat savagely out onto the thin sheet ice that cracked and ripped as the boat drove up onto it. The boatman commenced smashing at the ice with the blade of his oar and then started tossing decoys out to the side and behind him.<br><br>He's in a beautiful mood, the shooter thought. He's a big brute, too. I worked like a horse coming out here. He just pulled his weight and that's all. What the hell is eating him? This is his trade isn't it?<br><br>He arranged the shooting stool so he would have the maximum swing to left and right, opened a box of shells, and filled his pockets and opened another of the boxes of shells in the shell bag so he could reach into it easily. In front of him, where the lagoon lay glazed in the first light, was the black boat and the tall, heavily built boatman smashing with his oar at the ice and tossing decoys overboard as though he were ridding himself of something obscene.<br><br>It was getting lighter now and the shooter could see the low line of the near point across the lagoon. Beyond that point he knew there were two other shooting posts and far beyond it there was more marsh and then the open sea. He loaded both his guns and checked the position of the boat that was putting out decoys.<br><br>From behind him, he heard the incoming whisper of wings and he crouched, took hold of his right hand gun with his right hand as he looked up from under the rim of the barrel, then stood to shoot at the two ducks that were dropping down, their wings set to brake, coming down dark in the gray dim sky, slanting toward the decoys.<br><br>His head low, he swung the gun on a long slant, down, well and ahead of the second duck, then without looking at the result of his shot he raised the gun smoothly, up, up ahead and to the left of the other duck that was climbing to the left and as he pulled, saw it fold in flight and drop among the decoys in the broken ice. He looked to his right and saw the first duck a black patch on the same ice. He knew he had shot carefully on the first duck, far to the right of where the boat was, and on the second, high out and to the left, letting the duck climb far up and to the left to be sure the boat was out of any line of fire. It was a lovely double, shot exactly as he should have shot, with complete consideration and respect for the position of the boat, and he felt very good as he reloaded.<br><br>"Listen," the man in the boat called. "Don't shoot toward the boat."<br><br>I'll be a sad son of a bitch, the shooter said to himself. I will indeed.<br><br>"Get your decoys out," he called to the man in the boat. "But get them out fast. I won't shoot until they are all out. Except straight overhead."<br><br>The man in the boat said nothing that could be heard.<br><br>I can't figure it, the shooter thought to himself. He knows the game. He knows I split the work, or more, coming out. I never shot a safer or more careful duck in my life than that. What's the matter with him? I offered to put the dekes out with him. The hell with him.<br><br>Out on the right now, the boatman was still chopping angrily at the ice, and tossing out the wooden decoys in a hatred that showed in every move he made.<br><br>Don't let him spoil it, the shooter told himself. There won't be much shooting with this ice unless the sun should melt it later on. You probably will only have a few birds, so don't let him spoil it for you. You don't know how many more times you will shoot ducks and do not let anything spoil it for you.<br><br>He watched the sky lightening beyond the long point of marsh, and turning in the sunken barrel, he looked out across the frozen lagoon, and the marsh, and saw the snow-covered mountains a long way off. Low as he was, no foothills showed, and the mountains rose abruptly from the plain. As he looked toward the mountains he could feel a breeze on his face and he knew, then, the wind would come from there, rising with the sun, and that some birds would surely come flying in from the sea when the wind disturbed them.<br><br>The boatman had finished putting out the decoys. They were in two bunches, one straight ahead and to the left toward where the sun would rise, and the other to the shooter's right. Now he dropped over the hen mallard with her string and anchor, and the calling duck bobbed her head under water, and raising and dipping her head, splashed water onto her back.<br><br>"Don't you think it would be good to break more ice around the edges?" the shooter called to the boatman. "There's not much water to attract them."<br><br>The boatman said nothing but commenced to smash at the jagged perimeter of ice with his oar. This ice breaking was unnecessary and the boatman knew it. But the shooter did not know it and he thought, I do not understand him but I must not let him ruin it. I must keep it entire and not let him do it. Every time you shoot now can be the last shoot and no stupid son of a bitch should be allowed to ruin it. Keep your temper, boy, he told himself.<br><br>Copyright � 1950 by Ernest Hemmingway<br><br>Copyright renewed � 1978 by Mary Hemmingway</p><h2>Star Wars: Poe Dameron Vol. 5: The Spark and the Fire (Star Wars: Poe Dameron (2016))</h2><p>Lor San Tekka has been found!

Tracing the origins of the "incest taboo," blood rites, marriage, and the family, she reveals women s leading and still largely unknown contributions to the development of civilization. By pinpointing the relatively recent factors that led to pervasive discrimination against women as a sex, she offers fresh insights on the struggle against women s oppression and for the liberation of humanity.

The subject of winter - clearly the most inhospitable season for plein-air painting - provides some of the most exceptional and most spellbindingly beautiful paintings in Impressionism.<br>No exhibition and no publications in the literature on Impressionism have been devoted to this theme before. While such a thematic approach might seem at first blush a superficial one, the subject of this exhibition goes to the heart of one of the central issues of Impressionism, a dedication to painting specific effects of weather and light that is unprecedented in the history of art.<br><br> Inspired by Alfred Sisley's Snow at Louveciennes in The Phillips Collection, this exhibition of sixty-three works presents an opportunity to consider the subject of snow in Impressionist painting in an unprecedented way. While anyone might have come across one or two of these exceptional works in various works in this country or abroad, it comes as a surprise to most to learn that the Impressionists painted hundreds of paintings of snow or effets de neige, as they came to be called.<br><br> Of all the Impressionists, three artists especially were drawn to paint effets de neige: Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Camille Pissarro. Their shared fascination with these 'effets' led all three to repeatedly seek out opportunities to paint landscapes in snow. Yet each brought to the subject a highly individual response that we find reflected in the paintings assembled here. In addition to these three artists, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte and Paul Gauguin also painted snowscapes, though far fewer. Renoir's characteristic interest in a social gathering of skaters in the Bois de Boulogne, Caillebotte's dramatic elevated views over Paris, and Gauguin's rare Brittany snowscapes add dimension and contrast to the dedicated pursuit of winter landscape just outside Paris of Monet, Sisley, and Pisarro. The result is a wider range of winter scenes from the bucolic French countryside to ice floes on the Seine, from the paths and roads of small villages to the boulevards and rooftops of Paris. Their common ground is an obsession with winter light.<br><br>Most of us do not think of Paris-or the surrounding countryside-covered in snow. We do not anticipate a blizzard impeding winter travel to this part of of the world nor have we ever seen the Seine frozen solid. A very different weather pattern prevailed during the late 19th century. Snowfalls, blizzards, and frost were a fairly commen winter occurrence. Two of the most severe periods of extended cold since 1840 occurred during the winters of 1879-80 and 1890-91. In order to provide a backdrop of recorded weather conditions of the period, we brought together documentation from numerous sources to describe precisely the winter weather during the years covered by this exhibition . The weather was at times described as 'wolf-like' or 'Siberian,' and once was compared to the North Pole. These vivid accounts not only have helped us to assign dates to certain undated works, but also have provided a context for appreciating the impact of weather conditions on life in France in the late nineteenth century.<br></p><p>It may seem eccentric to gather together paintings according to the season they depict, but this large, handsome volume will make readers wonder why no one thought of it before. Winter is different from the other three seasons, with its extraordinary range of color and light--from subtle grays and pinks to deep blues and yellows--and the distinct absence of that difficult color, green. This book, the catalog of an exhibition at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., is a collection of more than 60 large color plates of impressionist paintings. They form a surprising group that presents each painting--even if it is already familiar--in a new way. The paintings are beautiful--Monet's <i>Magpie</i> soaking up the sun as he sits on a fence gate; Caillebotte's lacy iron balcony railing overlooking the Mansard roofs of Paris; Renoir's black-cloaked ice skaters in the Bois de Boulogne--but in this frigid season, the impressionists' penchant for working outdoors is arguably what is most impressive. In the introductory essay, Charles S. Moffett, the former director of the Phillips, deftly traces the artistic history of snow imagery from the Limbourg brothers' <i>Les Tr�s Riches Heures du duc de Berry</i> through Dutch 17th-century snowscapes, Caspar David Friedrich, and Claude Monet "and a few others," as he wryly quotes another historian's "nod" to the impressionists. There are three other essays--on Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley--by three other scholars, as well as lengthy, readable captions filled with quotes from the artists and discussions of their influences. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i>This intriguing, beautifully produced volume accompanies an exhibition of the same title currently at the Phillips Collection in Washington, DC, and then moving to the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. Four major essays by Impressionist scholars trace the manner in which winter weather and light, or "snow effect," were handled by important artists of the period, especially Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley. Briefer essays accompanying the catalog proper also discuss the winter scenes of Renoir, Caillebotte, and Gauguin. While all the essays are excellent, Moffett, former director of the Phillips Collection, does a particularly fine job of placing the snowscapes of the Impressionists in historical perspective, dating back to the work of the 15th-century Limbourg Brothers. This is a refreshing glimpse of one of the most heavily researched periods in modern art. Highly recommended for most collections.?P. Steven Thomas, Central Michigan Univ. Lib., Mt.

That project was abandoned quickly, but Leibniz remained in Paris with a singular goal: to get the most out of the city&#x2019;s intellectual and cultural riches. He benefited, above all, from his friendships with France&#x2019;s two greatest philosopher-theologians of the period, Antoine Arnauld and Nicolas de Malebranche. The interactions of these three men would prove of great consequence not only for Leibniz&#x2019;s own philosophy but for the development of modern philosophical and religious thought. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Despite their wildly different views and personalities, the three philosophers shared a single, passionate concern: resolving the problem of evil. Why is it that, in a world created by an allpowerful, all-wise, and infinitely just God, there is sin and suffering? Why do bad things happen to good people, and good things to bad people? <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>This is the story of a clash between radically divergent worldviews. But it is also a very personal story. At its heart are the dramatic&#x2014;and often turbulent&#x2014;relationships between three brilliant and resolute individuals. In this lively and engaging book, Steven Nadler brings to life a debate that obsessed its participants, captivated European intellectuals, and continues to inform our ways of thinking about God, morality, and the world. <br><br></p><p><br><br><p><b>Steven Nadler</b> is the William H. Hay II Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he has been teaching&nbsp;since 1988.&nbsp;His books include <i>Spinoza:&nbsp; A Life,&nbsp;</i>winner of the Koret Jewish&nbsp;Book Award in 2000, and <i>Rembrandt&#x2019;s Jews,</i> which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2004.</p><br><br>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Michael Dirda Many are likely to know just two facts about the great polymath Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716): first, that he and Newton independently discovered calculus at roughly the same time, then argued over who should get the credit (Newton won); and, second, that he maintained that ours was "the best of all possible worlds," a phrase much mocked in Voltaire's sparkling philosophical satire Candide. If people know anything further about this German thinker, it's likely to be that he spent his life trying to effect a reconciliation between Protestantism and Catholicism and that he postulated the existence of invisible, atom-like "monads" as the metaphysical building blocks of the universe. Poor Leibniz! For all his genius, he seems destined to be overshadowed by others, whether Newton, Voltaire or Spinoza (whom he visited, admired and disputed with) or, as Steven Nadler shows in The Best of All Possible Worlds, even by half-forgotten French priests. Of course, Nicolas Malebranche (1638-1715) and Antoine Arnauld (1612-1694) weren't simple provincial curates; they were, at least for the generation following the death of Descartes, France's strongest theological thinkers (excepting perhaps Pascal, who strangely enough barely figures in Nadler's book). Both Frenchmen knew the young Leibniz during his long stay in Paris, and all three corresponded with one another for decades afterward. Their lifelong, and sometimes heated, arguments about the nature of God form the basis of this engrossing book. Nadler makes clear the importance of their debate: "What was at stake was nothing less than the meaning of existence, the understanding of why things are as they are. The choice was clear: either the universe is ultimately an arbitrary product, the effect of an indifferent will guided by no objective values and subject to no independent canons of reason or goodness; or it is the result of wisdom, intelligible to its core and informed by a rationality and a sense of value that are, in essence, not very different from our own; or (to mention the most terrifying possibility of all) it simply is, necessary through its causes and transparent to the investigations of metaphysics and science but essentially devoid of any meaning or value whatsoever." The attempt to justify the ways of God to men -- theodicy, a term coined by Leibniz -- lies at the heart of the matter: "Why is there any evil at all in God's creation?" Essentially, Leibniz's answer is: Consider the whole. Explains Nadler, "It is not that everything will turn out for the best for me or for anyone else in particular. Nor is it necessarily the case that any other possible world would have been worse for me or for anyone else. Rather, Leibniz claims that any other possible world is worse overall than this one, regardless of any single person's fortunes in it." What is good for the whole isn't necessarily good for every one of its individual parts or components. As Nadler emphasizes, summarizing Leibniz, "all things are connected and every single aspect of the world makes a contribution to its being the best world." That includes what we call evil. However, Leibniz offers no explanation of just how evil assists the overall goodness of things. (Sometimes he even seems to suggest that it serves to bring the good into greater relief.) We cannot penetrate so far into the Creator's mind or plan. Still "it is inconceivable . . . that an infinitely good and perfect God could choose anything less than the best." This conclusion may satisfy a devout Christian philosopher, but it offers scant consolation when we are in pain, or see the wicked succeed and the worthy fail, or when we face death. Malebranche refined Leibniz's view by imagining that God needed to establish a world that wouldn't require constant adjustment or interference, one that ran on its own, following what He had determined were the simplest, most efficient general principles. Thus, "the actual world is not the most perfect world absolutely speaking; rather, it is only the most perfect world possible relative to those maximally simple laws." In other words, even God compromises. Our world could be better "but only at the cost of the simplicity of the means." Instead, Malebranche's Creator "wills to accomplish as much justice and goodness as He possibly can, not absolutely but consistent with the simplest laws." As Nadler emphasizes, to Malebranche "God . . . is more committed to acting in a general way and to a nature governed by the simplest laws than He is to the well-being of individuals." His "general volitions," as Malebranche dubs these cosmic rules, take precedence over "particular volitions," which are essentially those infrequent violations of the natural order that we call miracles. So it is in the established nature of things for it to rain, and sometimes the parched land receives needed water and sometimes rivers overflow. God isn't going to spend all his time constantly adjusting the weather and a zillion other phenomena just because the results aren't what the locals want or like. What Arnauld objects to in Malebranche (and also in Leibniz) is the supposition that God's nature is like humankind's and that our human intellects can have access to the divine wisdom. God, Arnauld believes, is utterly alien to us -- "a hidden God," to use a Jansenist catchphrase -- and to imagine him making logical decisions, or weighing the pluses and minuses of contrasting worlds, is absurd, nothing but anthropomorphism. (As Spinoza once observed, "a triangle, if it could speak would . . . say that God is eminently triangular, and a circle that God's nature is eminently circular.") In fact, men and women are by their lesser natures incapable of making sense of God or his mysterious ways, and all these presumptuous attempts at theodicy are doomed to failure. God wanted to make the world and so He did, and there's an end to it. In essence, Leibniz believes in God's goodness and wisdom, and Malebranche further emphasizes His rationality, but to Arnauld God is simply pure, omnipotent will. Which God you believe in matters: "Do we inhabit a cosmos that is fundamentally intelligible because its creation is grounded in a rational decision informed by certain absolute values? Is the world's existence the result of a reasonable act of creation and the expression of an infinite wisdom? Or, on the other hand, is the universe ultimately a nonrational, even arbitrary piece of work? . . . Does the origin of things lie in an indifferent action -- an apparently capricious exercise of causal power -- by a Creator who cannot possibly be motivated by reasons because His will finds no reasons independent of itself? In short, does the universe exist by ratio or by voluntas, by wisdom or power?" There's much more detail, and much greater subtlety, in Nadler's account of these differing theological views of God and His universe. (For instance, Spinoza contributes the further twist that "this is not the best of all possible worlds; it is the only possible world.") Of course, Leibniz, Malebranche and Arnauld all posit a Christian God of some sort, and their arguments may seem quaint to rationalists of a largely secular age. But to those who believe in, or simply wonder about, a God-governed universe, these three 17th-century thinkers raise serious and perennially fascinating questions: Is God moral and rational or completely arbitrary, even capricious? Is it wrong to kill only because God says so, or are there absolute moral values (as Kant would argue in establishing the categorical imperative, his variant on the Golden Rule)? And, to be almost bathetic, if God gives us grace to withstand temptation, why does he sometimes fail to give us enough? Besides this new book, Steven Nadler is the author of a magisterial biography of Spinoza, which I have read and recommend, and of impressive-sounding academic books on Arnauld and Malebranche, which I've only heard of. I can't imagine a better guide to 17th-century philosophical thought. Aimed at the general public, The Best of All Possible Worlds is written simply and clearly, without condescension, flashiness or over-simplification. But it's a demanding book nonetheless, and you need to pay attention. You'll be amply rewarded if you do. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

It is still a first--in its completeness and detail. This is a responsible book, subscribing to the view of true doll collectors: Do nothing to an antique doll that will compromise the authenticity and reduce its value. Whether a doll is a museum rarity, one of many common antique dolls, or a collectible, Marty Westfall's book will lead you through procedures to restore it. The exquisitely detailed step-by-step directions make it possible for collectors, dealers, even those who own just one or two treasured dolls, to make necessary repairs without reducing value. <br><br>The techniques that author Marty Westfall used from 1973 to 1979 and set down in this book are just as practical today. Her aim was to help the beginning restoration artist, and the information is just as valuable to even the most sophisticated collector. In easy-to-follow directions <b>The Handbook describes how to set stationary and sleep eyes, restring compo bodies, refurbish old wigs and make new ones, repair ball-jointed bodies, clean and repair kid bodies, make cloth bodies, mend chips and cracks, replace missing fingers and toes, and cope with other damages. </b><b>The Handbook</b> encourages those who wish to learn the art by taking them by the hand and showing them how to get started. At the back of the book is an updated list of suppliers for those who lack ready access to sources of repair materials. Other helpful information includes a chapter on how to distinguish between a legitimate replica doll and a fake made with the intention to deceive and another on how to determine whether a doll has been mended, even if the repair is so skillfully done that it is not readily apparent.<br><br>Thousands who began using this book as a guide have gone on to develop profitable careers in the restoration field. The same procedures to restore dolls work in restoring other porcelain objet d'arts, such as figurines. Many who began as doll makers have combined their creative art with restoring antique dolls. By learning the techniques in <b>The Handbook</b>, they have improved their skills in creating the valuable antique dolls of tomorrow.</p><p>Marty Westfall, born in Kentucky, now lives in southern Illinois. She has been a professional doll maker and restoration artist for 36 years. For 12 years, she created antique replicas for Dollspart Supply Company, who shipped them all over the world.

He describes himself as being on the trail of natural compounds that can treat diseases for which modern medicine has no cure . . . this is a quest powered by the desperation of the ill and the compassions of those who would cure them. If for no other reason than selfish self-interest, he argues, we must save the environments that create substances which could save us from discomfort, disease, and death. His survey of the possibilities includes a native South American potion for treating diabetes (it need only be drunk once every few weeks); substances offering extraordinary pain relief without grogginess; and mind-altering concoctions used under the guidance of a shaman with the aim of psychic and spiritual growth. Emerging high-tech medicine should be used to enhance, not abandon, the ancient cures, Plotkin urges, citing as a prime example the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporinwhich arises from a type of Scandinavian fungus.

His films include Hellraiser and Nightbreed."I have seen the future of the horror genre, and his name is Clive Barker," Stephen King has written. Fortunately, this first novel (Barker has published short story collections) more than bears the weight of King's praise. Barker is a better writer than King, and his characters are just as interesting. Set in modern Britain, the story thrusts a flawed "innocent"parolee Marty Straussinto an epic conflict between wealthy Joseph Whitehead and Mamoulian the Cardplayer, a centuries-old creature with whom Whitehead had struck a bargain to obtain his wealth and power. Whitehead reneges, and the resulting struggle is played out primarily on his fortress-like estate.

A towering athletic talent, Robinson&#x2019;s greater impact was on preparing the way for the civil rights reform wave following WWII. But Robinson&#x2019;s story has always been far more complex than the public perception has allowed. Brooklyn Dodgers executive Branch Rickey famously told the young Robinson that he was &#x201c;looking for a ballplayer with guts enough not to fight back.&#x201d; J. Christopher Schutz reveals the real Robinson, as a more defiant, combative spirit than simply the &#x201c;turn the other cheek&#x201d; compliant &#x201c;credit to his race.&#x201d; The triumph of Robinson&#x2019;s inclusion in the white Major Leagues (which presaged blacks&#x2019; later inclusion in the broader society) also included the slow demise of black-owned commercial enterprise in the Negro Leagues (which likewise presaged the unrecoverable loss of other important black institutions after civil rights gains). Examining this key figure at the crossroads of baseball and civil rights histories, Schutz provides a cohesive exploration of the man and the times that made him great.<br><br></p><p>J. Christopher Schutz is associate professor of history at Tennessee Wesleyan College, where he specializes in the Civil Rights Movement and social and cultural history of the 1960s and 1970s.Schutz, an associate professor of history at Tennessee Wesleyan College, portrays baseball legend Jackie Robinson as a 'compliant warrior,' a revamped version of a man whose temperament could sometimes make him 'prickly and difficult.' Those traits surfaced in his California youth in a gang and in the military, where he faced a court-martial for attacking a bigoted white officer. Robinson, determined to become a major league ball player despite segregation, joined the powerhouse Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro League in 1945. His play as an infielder led Brooklyn Dodgers president Branch Dickey to boldly select Robinson for the pioneering slot in the all-white major league. From the start of his time in the big show, Robinson confronted envy, jealousy, and hate from opposing players, teammates, and fans, yet he overcame it all with grit and determination. Schutz skillfully in depicting the totality of the star&#x2019;s personality on and off the field, without any sugar-coating or hype. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>This work takes a different look at one of the most discussed and analyzed players in baseball history. It&#x2019;s easy to accept the traditional narrative of who Jackie Robinson (1919&#x2013;72) was and how he impacted baseball in the United States. However, these mainstream notions aren&#x2019;t always accurate. Robinson may not have retaliated to the onslaught of negativity he experienced being the first African American major league ballplayer, but he was a determined and combative man who rebelled and fought against racial injustice throughout his life. Debut author Schutz (history, Tennessee Wesleyan Coll.) uses interviews and other sources to contrast the complex reality of who Robinson was with how he is traditionally depicted. Another interesting angle illustrates how Robinson&#x2019;s career and life both influenced and were influenced by the events and social context of the times. VERDICT Baseball fans and those interested in the civil rights movement will enjoy this book. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>Jackie Robinson appears as a committed, ambitious, sometimes difficult young man able to grapple with apartheid in the US, retain his considerable dignity, excel both on and off the baseball diamond, and pay a large price in terms of inordinate stress and the far too early breaking down of his once magnificent body. Historian Schutz sketches Robinson&#x2019;s progression from juvenile delinquency to stardom at UCLA (not USC) before he battled against Jim Crow military practices and a racist-spawned court-martial. After a brief stint with the Negro Leagues&#x2019; Kansas City Monarchs, Robinson was signed by Branch Rickey to become the first black ballplayer in organized baseball during the 20th century. Baseball&#x2019;s great experiment succeeded in large part because of Robinson&#x2019;s exceptional play and his ability to confront stark racism as a member of Brooklyn&#x2019;s famed boys of summer. Schutz nicely covers Robinson's postbaseball years, when he stood out as a racial spokesperson notwithstanding disappointments involving major political party figures and brickbats from black power advocates. Despite contending with horrific personal tragedy, Robinson became a hero for figures ranging from Martin Luther King Jr. to the white, southern-born sportswriter Red Smith.<br><br>Summing Up: Recommended. All levels/libraries. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Another perspective on the groundbreaking life of Jackie Robinson. We are all familiar with the story, but instead of taking it from a baseball point of view, it shows the results from a social impact perspective. It puts a different spin on the whole Jackie Robinson story and adds new insights to the entire story. Jackie Robinson&#x2019;s admirable legacy is about so much more than just baseball, and this is only one of the many different angles. (<i>Gregg's Baseball Bookcase</i>)<br><br>"For someone whose story has been told countless times, it is remarkable how little we know about the actual Jackie Robinson: the person who saw himself as a servant to the Black Freedom Struggle and, as he said, 'to the mass.' Christopher Schutz fills this gap in a manner that is utterly indispensable. It is a must read for people who like their history whole." (Dave Zirin, sports editor of The Nation and author of A People&#x2019;s History of Sports in the United States)<br><br>"Christopher Schutz provides a provocative and highly nuanced study of Jackie Robinson and the integration of Major League Baseball. Instead of portraying Robinson as someone who acquiesced to those in power in baseball and the larger American society, Schutz convincingly argues that the great athlete from UCLA by way of Cairo, Georgia and Pasadena, California, was a proud black man who through sheer determination and unyielding combativeness was able to achieve success before, during, and after his career in America's national pastime. In the process of telling the Robinson story, Schutz provides important insights into the business of baseball and the complex and ever changing interconnection among race, sport, and American culture."

Wiggins, George Mason University)</p><h2>A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War</h2><p>A New Birth of Freedom is the culmination of over a half a century of study and reflection by one of America&#39;s foremost scholars of American politics, Harry V. Jaffa. This long-awaited sequel to Crisis of the House Divided, first published in 1959, continues Jaffa&#39;s piercing examination of the political thought of Abraham Lincoln and the themes of self-government, equality, and statesmanship. Whereas Crisis of the House Divided focused on the famous senate campaign debates between Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, this volume expands and deepens Jaffa&#39;s analysis of American political thought, and gives special attention to Lincoln&#39;s refutation of the arguments of John C. Calhoun-the intellectual champion of the Confederacy.</p><p><b>Harry V. Jaffa</b> is the Henry Salvatori Professor of Political Philosophy Emeritus at Claremont McKenna College and Claremont Graduate University, a distinguished fellow of the Claremont Institute, and the author of ten books.Jaffa has again delivered a powerful contribution to Lincoln scholarship. Historians will find many riches in Jaffa's latest learned volume. (Michael Vorenberg <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>Harry V. Jaffa takes his time. The wait is well worth it. In unpacking Lincoln's great speeches and debate orations, Jaffa shows what an astute, formidable, and brilliant interlocutor Lincoln was. (Jean Bethke Elshtain <i>Civil War Book Review</i>)<br><br>On exhibit in this book is a powerful intellect. . . . Among the prominent Americans who are brilliantly illuminated here as they have rarely been are Thomas Jefferson, John C. Calhoun, Jefferson Davis, and, of course, Abraham Lincoln. (George Anastaplo, author of Abraham Lincoln: A Constitutional Biography)<br><br><i>A New Birth of Freedom</i> more than meets the critical expectations that Professor Jaffa has invited in the years since his acclaimed study, <i>Crisis of the House Divided: An Interpretation of the Lincoln-Douglas Debates</i>, reoriented scholarly investigation of Abraham Lincoln and the coming the Civil War. A work of profound historical erudition and disciplined philosophical criticism, Jaffa's new work offers an original analysis of the crisis of the Union in the perspective of the western political tradition and in the context of the constitutional principles of the American Revolution. More judiciously than any other twentieth-century scholar writing in the nationalist tradition, Jaffa meets the challenge posed by the political philosophy and constitutional constructions of John C. Calhoun and the southern secessionists. Recognizing the openness of the historical situation that existed in 1861, Jaffa provides the most searching and fair-minded analysis of Lincoln's reasons for resisting secession that I have ever read. (Herman Belz, University of Maryland, College Park)<br><br>Four decades ago, Harry Jaffa offered powerful insights on the Lincoln-Douglas debates in his <i>Crisis of the House Divided</i>. In this long-awaited sequel, he picks up the threads of that earlier study in this stimulating new interpretation of the showdown conflict between slavery and freedom in the election of 1860 and the secession crisis that followed. Every student of Lincoln needs to read and ponder this book. (James M. McPherson, Princeton University)<br><br>With <i>A New Birth of Freedom</i> Harry V. Jaffa reestablishes himself as the greatest living scholar of Lincoln's political thought and Lincoln's greatest defender, period. Jaffa's analysis of the First Inaugural is without parallel as he demonstrates once and for all the incoherence of Calhoun's arguments for the southern secession. For every citizen interested in the preservation of the American union and the principles on which it rests, Jaffa's book is a must-read. (Steven B. Smith, Yale University)<br><br>Harry V. Jaffa's <i>A New Birth of Freedom</i> is a brilliant and incisive explication of the political ideas that were at the heart of the coming of the Civil War. Jaffa is at his very best in demolishing the currently fashionable argument that the ideal of equality was not part of the American constitutional system from its beginning. This is a work of deep learning and great relevance, both to Lincoln's time and our own. It is a worthy sequel to the author's classic study, <i>A Crisis of the House Divided</i>. (William E. Gienapp, Harvard University)<br><br>Forty years ago, Harry Jaffa wrote the greatest book on Abraham Lincoln's politics for a generation; now, Jaffa has written the greatest book on Lincoln's politics for another generation. <i>A New Birth of Freedom</i> is a relentless, powerful analysis of how Abraham Lincoln claimed the high intellectual ground of right, of universality, and of prudence from the romantic and racist ideology of John Calhoun&#x2014;and claims it still from the shadow of Calhoun's postmodern imitators. (Allen C. Guelzo, author of Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President)<br><br>Harry Jaffa's Crisis of the House Divided could rank as the 'first book' of American political science, for it showed how the whole tradition of political philosophy was brought to bear, by a gifted political man, on the gravest crisis of the American regime. For the same reason, that book stands, even today, as the best book ever written on Lincoln: it gave an account of Lincoln at the highest level, by actually taking seriously the substance of Lincoln's political thought. In A New Birth of Freedom, Jaffa provides the sequel, long-awaited. It is a sublime work, advancing and deepening the first. Lincoln comes out even more clearly in this new book as a model of 'classic statesmanship,' set off against all of the moral premises that would come with modernity, as Right and Left, would back into nihilism and reject the moral tradition. In Jaffa's hand, the account of Lincoln reaches the poetic, as indeed it must, for as the author allows, 'the place of the necessity in great poetry imposed by the artist may be occupied by a providential order in history, revealed in the speeches of the tragic hero.' (Hadley Arkes, Amherst College)<br><br>Forty years after his <i>Crisis of the House Divided</i>, widely recognized as a classic analysis of the ideas articulated in the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Harry Jaffa has brought the same combination of impressive learning, breadth of knowledge and bold argument to his study of Lincoln's ideas at the outbreak of war. He places Lincoln's thought in a rich and broad context that ranges from Plato and Aristotle, and Dante and Shakespeare to Jefferson and Calhoun. This is a distinctive and provocative contribution to the current debate about the ideology and the ideals of America's greatest president.

In fact, as J.B. MacKinnon argues in this unorthodox look at the disappearing wilderness, we are living in the midst of a disaster thousands of years in the making&#x2014;and we hardly notice it. We have forgotten what nature can be and adapted to a diminished world of our own making.<br><br>In <i>The Once and Future World</i>, MacKinnon invites us to remember nature as it was, to reconnect to nature in a meaningful way, and to remake a wilder world everywhere. He goes looking for landscapes untouched by human hands. He revisits a globe exuberant with life, where lions roam North America and ten times more whales swim in the sea. He shows us that the vestiges of lost nature surround us every day: buy an avocado at the grocery store and you have a seed designed to pass through the digestive tracts of huge animals that have been driven extinct.<br><br><i>The Once and Future World</i> is a call for an &#x201c;age of rewilding,&#x201d; from planting milkweed for butterflies in our own backyards to restoring animal migration routes that span entire continents.

The daughter of Belgarath and the shape-shifter Poledra, she has fought wars, plotted palace coups, and worked her powerful magic for three thousand years.

I think all Eddings' fans are: she's the ultimate woman. And I mean that in a down-to-earth, very practical sense: of course she's gorgeous and a mighty sorceress, but she's also the one who has to pack when they're going on some epic quest; she's the one who makes sure they eat sensibly: gruel and tea instead of roast ox and beer for breakfast.

Nydell combines her many years of experience living in the region with her special linguistic expertise to offer today's students insights they are obliged to critically consider before study or research abroad. The accessible presentation succeeds in humanizing as it reveals both the difficult issues and the abiding values that govern people's experiences. Nydell reminds us that in the Middle East and North Africa there will be much more to grasp as continued rapid change alters those lives daily.&#x2015;<b>Terrence M. Potter, Visiting Associate Professor, Georgetown University</b><br><br>This book is a must-read for anyone wanting to comprehend the Middle East.

She provides profound insights into Arabs' perceptions underlying political events, and our interactions with each other.&#x2015;<b>Elizabeth McKune, Executive Director, Sultan Qaboos Cultural Center, and Former US Ambassador to the State of Qatar</b><br><br>This is an important and fascinating book, especially for Americans in the crucial time in U.S.-Arab relations. Dr. Nydell presents a timely, lucid, and engaging guide to the values and cultures of the Arab world, based on her many years of working and living there, and on her training as a professional linguist. This candid and wonderfully readable book captures the contrasts and the characteristics of this great civilization and brings them vividly to life for a Western audience.&#x2015;<b>Karin Ryding, PhD, Sultan Qaboos bin Said Professor of Arabic, and Chair of the Department of Arabic Language, Georgetown University</b><br><br>Middle East specialists have long relied on their worn copies of Understanding Arabs for insights about Arab social behaviour.. A whole generation of U.S. diplomats were introduced to the subject by Dr. Nydell in the 1970s and 1980s. In this concise and practical guide, she shares her wealth of scholarly and real-world experience, and she does so without the psycho-babble that too often dominates the other surveys of the subject.&#x2015;<b>Ambassador David L.

It is an up-to-date atlas of the observable part of the moon. Maps of the moon compose the bulk of the book's 224 pages.<p>The introduction discusses history, terminology, phases of the moon, and the moon's surface. This is followed by maps of 76 sections of the near side of the moon, each accompanied by a small locator map. Facing pages include place-names and their derivations as well as map coordinates. Following the maps are photographs of interesting lunar formations (craters, ring mountains, walled plains), advice on setting up and using a telescope, descriptions of eclipses, and a glossary. There is a thorough bibliography and index of named formations at the end of the book. One can look up <i>Amundsen</i>, for example, and locate the ring mountain named after him.</p><p>The only comparable works are <i>Moon-Mars-Venus</i> (Hamlyn, 1976) and Alter's <i>Pictorial Guide to the Moon</i> (1967). This new book has far more information clearly presented, and names are up-to-date. As director of the Prague Planetarium, the author is knowledgeable and explains terms clearly. Any library with even one patron interested in or studying astronomy should consider this book. <i></i></p></p><h2>The Devil&#39;s Pleasure Palace: The Cult of Critical Theory and the Subversion of the West</h2><p>In the aftermath of World War II, America stood alone as the world&#x2019;s premier military power. Yet its martial confidence contrasted vividly with its sense of cultural inferiority. Still looking to a defeated and dispirited Europe for intellectual and artistic guidance, the burgeoning transnational elite in New York and Washington embraced not only the war&#x2019;s refugees, but many of their ideas as well, and nothing has proven more pernicious than those of the Frankfurt School and its reactionary philosophy of critical theory.&#x201d;<br><br>In <i>The Devil's Pleasure Palace</i>, Michael Walsh describes how Critical Theory released a horde of demons into the American psyche. When everything could be questioned, nothing could be real, and the muscular, confident empiricism that had just won the war gave way, in less than a generation, to a central-European nihilism celebrated on college campuses across the United States. Seizing the high ground of academe and the arts, the New Nihilists set about dissolving the bedrock of the country, from patriotism to marriage to the family to military service. They have sown, as Cardinal Bergoglio now Pope Francis once wrote of the Devil, destruction, division, hatred, and calumny,&#x201d; and all disguised as the search for truth.<br><br><i>The Devil's Pleasure Palace</i> exposes the overlooked movement that is Critical Theory and explains how it took root in America and, once established and gestated, how it has affected nearly every aspect of American life and society.<br></p><p>Michael Walsh is a journalist, author, and screenwriter, whose work includes six novels, seven works of nonfiction, and a hit Disney movie. The former classical music critic of <i>Time</i> magazine, he is now a regular contributor of political and cultural commentary to PJ Media and <i>National Review</i>,&nbsp;and an occasional op-ed columnist for the <i>New York Post</i>.

As broadcaster and pitchman, John Madden has been inside the locker rooms, broadcasts booths, and in front of the camera doing what he does best--being himself. He&#39;s seen an awful lot and he wrote a book to prove it. Hey, wait a minute, you&#39;ll love it!</p><p></p><h2>Mirror</h2><p>Two diverse countries and cultures are linked with warmth and charm in this two-in-one picture book. This innovative picture book comprises two stories designed to be read simultaneously - one from the left, the other from the right. Page by page, we experience the lives of two little boys - one from an urban family in Sydney, Australia, the other from Morocco. From busy motorways to desert landscapes, these worlds couldn&#39;t be further apart. Yet with the journey of a homemade Moroccan carpet into the Australian boy&#39;s home, we can see how these separate lives become intertwined. At the book&#39;s conclusion, the family in Sydney can be seen enjoying their new purchase together while the Moroccan family are surfing the internet. A powerful book, &#34;Mirror&#34; illustrates how our lives reflect each other and that we are all, even in some small way, connected. It features innovative dual-book format, effectively communicating the way people&#39;s experiences and values are shared, despite geographical and cultural differences. The essential story is conveyed wordlessly, while the short introduction and author&#39;s note appear in both English and Arabic. There is a keystone in the vital bridge across the East-West gap.</p><p>Jeannie Baker is the author and illustrator of a number of children&#39;s picture books, including the award-winning Where the Forest Meets the Sea and the critically acclaimed dual language picture book Mirror. Her characteristic use of mixed media to create detailed and elaborate collages is stunning and unique. Originally from the UK, Jeannie lives in Australia. Find Jeannie online at www.jeanniebaker.com.Starred Review. PreSchool-Grade 4&#x2014;In <i>Window</i> (1991) and Home (2004, both Greenwillow), Baker combined a concept, her signature collages, and a wordless format to underscore environmental issues. <i>Mirror</i> illuminates the common humanity beneath the surface of cultural differences. In a clever design, two sets of bound signatures face one another, the gatherings reversed from their normal location inside the spine; readers manipulate the two openings simultaneously. In parallel narratives, two boys awaken in the moonlight, accompany their fathers on an errand, and return home. In the story on the left, the destination is a hardware emporium in Sydney, Australia. Materials for an indoor fireplace are purchased and put in a van. The right side occurs in Morocco. Father and son mount a donkey and travel a long distance to sell a hand-woven rug and buy a computer at the market. After a family dinner, they turn it on and the Australians settle onto a fireside carpet matching the one in the other story. The size, shape, and number of the panels in one story are reflected in the other, a choice that assists with comparison. English and Arabic paragraphs introduce the visual narratives. A diagram indicates the right-to-left orientation of the Moroccan story. Baker's skill in orchestrating fabric, vegetation, clay, and other materials into scenes with the proper scale and convincing depth is a wonder to behold. The author's notes hint at her purpose and process. A fresh take on a timely and timeless message.&#x2014;<i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2011. &nbsp;Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

But before leaving his much-loved home in North Yorkshire, Bryson insisted on taking one last trip around Britain, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home. His aim was to take stock of the nation&#39;s public face and private parts (as it were), and to analyse what precisely it was he loved so much about a country that had produced Marmite, a military hero whose dying wish was to be kissed by a fellow named Hardy, place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey and Shellow Bowells, people who said &#39;Mustn&#39;t grumble&#39;, and Gardeners&#39; Question Time.</p><p>Reacting to an itch common to Midwesterners since there's been a Midwest from which to escape, writer Bill Bryson moved from Iowa to Britain in 1973. Working for such places as <i>Times</i> of London, among others, he has lived quite happily there ever since. Now Bryson has decided his native country needs him--but first, he's going on a roundabout jaunt on the island he loves. <p> Britain fascinates Americans: it's familiar, yet alien; the same in some ways, yet so different. Bryson does an excellent job of showing his adopted home to a Yank audience, but you never get the feeling that Bryson is too much of an outsider to know the true nature of the country. <i>Notes from a Small Island</i> strikes a nice balance: the writing is American-silly with a British range of vocabulary. Bryson's marvelous ear is also in evidence: "... I noted the names of the little villages we passed through--Pinhead, West Stuttering, Bakelite, Ham Hocks, Sheepshanks ..." If you're an Anglophile, you'll devour <i>Notes from a Small Island</i>.</p>"Suddenly, in the space of a moment, I realized what it was that I loved about Britain--which is to say, all of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every last bit of it, good and bad--old churches, country lanes, people saying 'Mustn't grumble' and 'I'm terribly sorry but,' people apologizing to <i>me</i> when I conk them with a careless elbow, milk in bottles, beans on toast, haymaking in June, seaside piers, Ordinance Survey maps, tea and crumpets, summer showers and foggy winter evenings--every bit of it."<br><br>After nearly two decades in Britain, Bill Bryson, the acclaimed author of such bestsellers as <i>The Mother Tongue</i> and <i>Made in America</i>, decided it was time to move back to the United States for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was partly to let his wife and kids experience life in Bryson's homeland--and partly because he had read that 3.7 million Americans believed that they had been abducted by aliens at one time or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was thus clear to him that his people needed him.<br><br>But before leaving his much-loved home in North Yorkshire, Bryson insisted on taking one last trip around Britain, a sort of valedictory tour of the green and kindly island that had so long been his home.&nbsp;&nbsp;His aim was to take stock of modern-day Britain, and to analyze what he loved so much about a country that had produced Marmite, zebra crossings, and place names like Farleigh Wallop, Titsey, and Shellow Bowells.<br><br>With characteristic wit and irreverence, Bill Bryson presents the ludicrous and the endearing in equal measure.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a hilarious social commentary that conveys the true glory of Britain.</p><h2>The Maiden of Mayfair (Tales of London Series #1)</h2><p>This heartwarming Victorian rags-to-riches story puts orphan Sarah Matthews into a posh Berkeley Square home. Tales of London book 1.</p><p>Lawana Blackwell is a full-time writer and the author of the the bestselling GRESHAM CHRONICLES series. A writing course at Louisiana State University rekindled her dream of writing, then she learned the craft of writing fiction under bestselling author Gilbert Morris. She and her husband live in Louisiana and have three sons.In <i>The Maiden of Mayfair,</i> first in her Victorian Tales of London series, Blackwell evokes Dickens rather than the Brontes in her portrait of young Sarah Matthews. Sarah is the ward of the St. Matthew Methodist Foundling Home for Girls in Drury Lane. Although the orphanage is grim, she's lucky, for abandoned children are everywhere and often perish in the streets. And soon Sarah is rescued by a rich widow who suspects Sarah may be her granddaughter, the daughter of her profligate son. Blackwell's Victorian romances can seem tame even for the Christian market, although her period detail is always fine, and this series looks to be livelier than some of its predecessors. <i>John Mort</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But this fast-paced mystery is unusual in that the author states up front that the historical information in the book is all factually accurate. But is this claim true?<br> As historian Bart D. Ehrman shows in this informative and witty book, <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> is filled with numerous historical mistakes. Did the ancient church engage in a cover-up to make the man Jesus into a divine figure? Did Emperor Constantine select for the New Testament--from some 80 contending Gospels--the only four Gospels that stressed that Jesus was divine? Was Jesus Christ married to Mary Magdalene? Did the Church suppress Gospels that told the secret of their marriage? Bart Ehrman thoroughly debunks all of these claims. But the book is not merely a laundry list of Brown's misreading of history. Throughout, Ehrman offers a wealth of fascinating background information--all historically accurate--on early Christianity. He describes, for instance, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (which are <em>not</em> Christian in content, contrary to <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>); outlines in simple terms how scholars of early Christianity determine which sources are most reliable; and explores the many other Gospels that have been found in the last half century. <br> Ehrman separates fact from fiction, the historical realities from the flights of literary fancy. Readers of <em>The Da Vinci Code</em> who would like to know the truth about the beginnings of Christianity and the life of Jesus will find this book riveting.</p><p><br><strong>Bart D. Ehrman</strong> chairs the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. An authority on the early Church and the life of Jesus, he has appeared on A&amp;E, the History Channel, CNN, and other television and radio shows. He has taped several highly popular lecture series for the "Teaching Company" and is the author of <em>Jesus, Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium</em> (OUP, 1999), <em>Lost Christianities</em> (OUP, 2004) and <em>Lost Scriptures</em> (OUP, 2004).<br>THE DA VINCI CODE is currently fueling conversation in Sunday school classes across the nation. Though sold as fiction, it claims to be true, to better support our suspension of disbelief. Bart D. Ehrman, a scholar of biblical history, has undertaken a gentle debunking, using an archaeological approach to uncover the historical context of Jesus's life and the birth of the church. Ehrman reads his own text in a pleasant, unhurried tenor voice, revealing a history more complex than either the novel or the church would admit. The simplicity and straightforward clarity of the presentation demonstrate the true mystery at the center of Dan Brown's potboiler and the patient, confident manner of a true scientist and master lecturer.

The wound stung like fuck, but it wasn&#x2019;t as bad as some I&#x2019;d had. The blaster bolt came in blind across my ribs, already weakened by the door plating it had to chew through to get to me. Priests, up against the slammed door and looking for a quick gut shot. Fucking amateur night. They&#x2019;d probably caught almost as much pain themselves from the point-blank blowback off the plating. Behind the door, I was already twisting aside. What was left of the charge plowed a long, shallow gash across my rib cage and went out, smoldering in the folds of my coat. Sudden ice down that side of my body and the abrupt stench of fried skin-sensor components. That curious bone-splinter fizzing that&#x2019;s almost a taste, where the bolt had ripped through the biolube casing on the floating ribs.<br><br> Eighteen minutes later, by the softly glowing display chipped into my upper left field of vision, the same fizzing was still with me as I hurried down the lamplit street, trying to ignore the wound. Stealthy seep of fluids beneath my coat. Not much blood. Sleeving synthetic has its advantages.<br><br> &#x201c;Looking for a good time, sam?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Already had one,&#x201d; I told him, veering away from the doorway. He blinked wave-tattooed eyelids in a dismissive flutter that said your loss and leaned his tightly muscled frame languidly back into the gloom. I crossed the street and took the corner, tacking between a couple more whores, one a woman, the other of indeterminate gender. The woman was an augment, forked dragon tongue flickering out around her overly prehensile lips, maybe tasting my wound on the night air. Her eyes danced a similar passage over me, then slid away. On the other side, the cross-gender pro shifted its stance slightly and gave me a quizzical look but said nothing. Neither was interested. The streets were rain-slick and deserted, and they&#x2019;d had longer to see me coming than the doorway operator. I&#x2019;d cleaned up since leaving the citadel, but something about me must have telegraphed the lack of business opportunity.<br><br> At my back, I heard them talking about me in Stripjap. I heard the word for broke.<br><br> They could afford to be choosy. In the wake of the Mecsek Initiative, business was booming. Tekitomura was packed that winter, thronging with salvage brokers and the deCom crews that drew them the way a trawler wake draws ripwings. Making New Hok Safe for a New Century, the ads went. From the newly built hoverloader dock down at the Kompcho end of town it was less than a thousand kilometers, straight-line distance, to the shores of New Hokkaido, and the &#x2019;loaders were running day and night. Outside of an airdrop, there is no faster way to get across the Andrassy Sea. And on Harlan&#x2019;s World, you don&#x2019;t go up in the air if you can possibly avoid it. Any crew toting heavy equipment&#x2014;and they all were&#x2014;was going to New Hok on a hoverloader out of Tekitomura. Those that lived would be coming back the same way.<br><br> Boomtown. Bright new hope and brawling enthusiasm as the Mecsek money poured in. I limped down thoroughfares littered with the detritus of spent human merriment. In my pocket, the freshly excised cortical stacks clicked together like dice.<br><br> There was a fight going on at the intersection of Pencheva Street and Muko Prospect. The pipe houses on Muko had just turned out and their synapse-fried patrons had met late-shift dockworkers coming up through the decayed quiet of the warehouse quarter. More than enough reason for violence. Now a dozen badly coordinated figures stumbled back and forth in the street, flailing and clawing inexpertly at each other while a gathered crowd shouted encouragement. One body already lay inert on the fused-glass paving, and someone else was dragging their body, a limb&#x2019;s length at a time, out of the fray, bleeding. Blue sparks shorted off a set of overcharged power knuckles; elsewhere light glimmered on a blade. But everyone still standing seemed to be having a good time, and there were no police as yet.<br><br> Yeah, part of me jeered. Probably all too busy up the hill right now.<br><br> I skirted the action as best I could, shielding my injured side. Beneath the coat, my hands closed on the smooth curve of the last hallucinogen grenade and the slightly sticky hilt of the Tebbit knife.<br><br> Never get into a fight if you can kill quickly and be gone.<br><br> Virginia Vidaura&#x2014;Envoy Corps trainer, later career criminal and sometime political activist. Something of a role model for me, though it was several decades since I&#x2019;d last seen her. On a dozen different worlds, she crept into my mind unbidden, and I owed that ghost in my head my own life a dozen times over. This time I didn&#x2019;t need her or the knife. I got past the fight without eye contact, made the corner of Pencheva, and melted into the shadows that lay across the alley mouths on the seaward side of the street. The timechip in my eye said I was late.<br><br> Pick it up, Kovacs. According to my contact in Millsport, Plex wasn&#x2019;t all that reliable at the best of times, and I hadn&#x2019;t paid him enough to wait long.<br><br> Five hundred meters down and then left into the tight fractal whorls of Belacotton Kohei Section, named centuries ago for the habitual content and the original owner-operator family whose warehouse frontages walled the curving maze of alleys. With the Unsettlement and the subsequent loss of New Hokkaido as any kind of market, the local belaweed trade pretty much collapsed and families like Kohei went rapidly bankrupt. Now the grime-filmed upper-level windows of their fa�ades peered sadly across at each other over gape-mouthed loading bay entrances whose shutters were all jammed somewhere uncommitted between open and closed.<br><br> There was talk of regeneration, of course, of reopening units like these and retooling them as deCom labs, training centers, and hardware storage facilities. Mostly, it was still just talk&#x2014;the enthusiasm had kindled on the wharf-line units facing the hoverloader ramps farther west, but so far it hadn&#x2019;t spread farther in any direction than you could trust a wirehead with your phone. This far off the wharf and this far east, the chitter of Mecsek finance was still pretty inaudible.<br><br> The joys of trickledown.<br><br> Belacotton Kohei Nine Point Twenty-six showed a faint glow in one upper window, and the long restless tongues of shadows in the light that seeped from under the half-cranked loading bay shutter gave the building the look of a one-eyed, drooling maniac. I slid to the wall and dialed up the synthetic sleeve&#x2019;s auditory circuits for what they were worth, which wasn&#x2019;t much. Voices leaked out into the street, fitful as the shadows at my feet.<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2014;telling you, I&#x2019;m not going to hang around for that.&#x201d;<br><br> It was a Millsport accent, the drawling metropolitan twang of Harlan&#x2019;s World Amanglic dragged up to an irritated jag. Plex&#x2019;s voice, muttering below sense-making range, made soft provincial counterpoint. He seemed to be asking a question.<br><br> &#x201c;How the fuck would I know that? Believe what you want.&#x201d; Plex&#x2019;s companion was moving about, handling things. His voice faded back in the echoes of the loading bay. I caught the words kaikyo, matter, a chopped laugh. Then again, coming closer to the shutter, &#x201c;&#x2014;matters is what the family believes, and they&#x2019;ll believe what the technology tells them. Technology leaves a trail, my friend.&#x201d; A sharp coughing and indrawn breath that sounded like recreational chemicals going down. &#x201c;This guy is fucking late.&#x201d;<br><br> I frowned. Kaikyo has a lot of meanings, but they all depend on how old you are. Geographically, it&#x2019;s a strait or a channel. That&#x2019;s early-Settlement-years use, or just hypereducated, kanji-scribbling, First Families pretension. This guy didn&#x2019;t sound First Family, but there was no reason he couldn&#x2019;t have been around back when Konrad Harlan and his well-connected pals were turning Glimmer VI into their own personal backyard. Plenty of DH personalities still on stack from that far back, just waiting to be downloaded into a working sleeve. Come to that, you wouldn&#x2019;t need to resleeve more than half a dozen times, end-to-end, to live through the whole of Harlan&#x2019;s World&#x2019;s human history anyway. It&#x2019;s still not much over four centuries, Earth-standard, since the colony barges made planetfall.<br><br> Envoy intuition twisted about in my head. It felt wrong. I&#x2019;d met men and women with centuries of continuous life behind them, and they didn&#x2019;t talk like this guy. This wasn&#x2019;t the wisdom of ages, drawling out into the Tekitomura night over pipe fumes.<br><br> On the street, scavenged into the argot of Stripjap a couple of hundred years later, kaikyo means a contact who can shift stolen goods. A covert flow manager. In some parts of the Millsport Archipelago, it&#x2019;s still common usage. Elsewhere, the meaning is shifting to describe aboveboard financial consultants.<br><br> Yeah, and farther south it means a holy man possessed by spirits, or a sewage outlet. Enough of this detective shit. You heard the man&#x2014;you&#x2019;re late.<br><br> I got the heel of one hand under the edge of the shutter and hauled upward, locking up the tidal rip of pain from my wound as well as the synthetic sleeve&#x2019;s nervous system would let me. The shutter ratcheted noisily to the roof. Light fell out into the street and all over me.<br><br> &#x201c;Evening.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; The Millsport accent jerked back a full step. He&#x2019;d been only a couple of meters away from the shutter when it went up.<br><br> &#x201c;Tak.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hello, Plex.&#x201d; My eyes stayed on the newcomer. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the tan?&#x201d;<br><br> By then I already knew. Pa...</p><h2>END OF ETERNITY</h2><p>Andrew Harlan is an Eternal, a man whose job it is to range through past and present Centuries, monitoring and, where necessary, altering Time&#39;s myriad cause-and-effect relationships. But when Harlan meets and falls for a non-Eternal woman, he seeks to use the awesome powers and techniques of the Eternals to twist time for his own purposes, so that he and his love can survive together.</p><p>Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) was born in Russia and taken to America in 1923, becoming an American citizen in 1928. He took a degree in chemistry from Columbia University in 1939, and took his MA in 1941 and his PhD in 1948, after spending the war years in the Naval Air Experimental Station. He joined the Boston University School of Medicine in 1949, becoming associate professor of biochemistry. He is best known for the Robot and Foundation sequences.<p>1. TECHNICIAN</p><p>Andrew Harlan stepped into the kettle. Its sides were perfectly round and it fit snugly inside a vertical shaft composed of widely spaced rods that shimmered into an unseeable haze six feet above Harlan&#x2019;s head. Harlan set the controls and moved the smoothly working starting lever.</p><p>The kettle did not move.</p><p>Harlan did not expect it to. He expected no movement; neither up nor down, left nor right, forth nor back. Yet the spaces between the rods had melted into a gray blankness which was solid to the touch, though nonetheless immaterial for all that. And there was the little stir in his stomach, the faint (psychosomatic?) touch of dizziness, that told him that all the kettle contained, including himself, was rushing upwhen through Eternity.</p><p>He had boarded the kettle in the 575th Century, the base of operations assigned him two years earlier. At the time the 575th had been the farthest upwhen he had ever traveled. Now he was moving upwhen to the 2456th Century.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances he might have felt a little lost at the prospect. His native Century was in the far downwhen, the 95th Century, to be exact. The 95th was a Century stiffly restrictive of atomic power, faintly rustic, fond of natural wood as a structural material, exporters of certain types of distilled potables to nearly everywhen and importers of clover seed. Although Harlan had not been in the 95th since he entered special training and became a Cub at the age of fifteen, there was always that feeling of loss when one moved outwhen from "home." At the 2456th he would be nearly two hundred forty millennia from his birth when and that is a sizable distance even for a hardened Eternal.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances all this would be so.</p><p>But right now Harlan was in poor mood to think of anything but the fact that his documents were heavy in his pocket and tense, a little confused.</p><p>It was his hands acting by themselves that brought the kettle to the proper halt at the proper Century.</p><p>Strange that a Technician should feel tense or nervous about anything. What was it that Educator Yarrow had once said:</p><p>"Above all, a Technician must be dispassionate. The Reality Change he initiates may affect the lives of as many as fifty billion people. A million or more of these may be so drastically affected as to be considered new individuals. Under these conditions, an emotional make-up is a distinct handicap."</p><p>Harlan put the memory of his teacher&#x2019;s dry voice out of his mind with an almost savage shake of his head. In those days he had never imagined that he himself would have the peculiar talent for that very position. But emotion had come upon him after all. Not for fifty billion people. What in Time did he care for fifty billion people? There was just one. One person.</p><p>He became aware that the kettle was stationary and with the merest pause to pull his thoughts together, put himself into the cold, impersonal frame of mind a Technician must have, he stepped out. The kettle he left, of course, was not the same as the one he had boarded, in the sense that it was not composed of the same atoms. He did not worry about that any more than any Eternal would. To concern oneself with the mystique of Time-travel, rather than with the simple fact of it, was the mark of the Cub and newcomer to Eternity.</p><p>He paused again at the infinitely thin curtain of non-Space and non-Time which separated him from Eternity in one way and from ordinary Time in another.</p><p>This would be a completely new section of Eternity for him. He knew about it in a rough way, of course, having checked upon it in the Temporal Handbook. Still, there was no substitute for actual appearance and he steeled himself for the initial shock of adjustment.</p><p>He adjusted the controls, a simple matter in passing into Eternity (and a very complicated one in passing into Time, a type of passage which was correspondingly less frequent). He stepped through the curtain and found himself squinting at the brilliance. Automatically he threw up his hand to shield his eyes.</p><p>Only one man faced him. At first Harlan could see him only blurrily.</p><p>The man said, "I am Sociologist Kantor Voy. I imagine you are Technician Harlan."</p><p>Harlan nodded and said, "Father Time! Isn&#x2019;t this sort of ornamentation adjustable?"</p><p>Voy looked about and said tolerantly, "You mean the molecular films?"</p><p>"I certainly do," said Harlan. The Handbook had mentioned them, but had said nothing of such an insane riot of light reflection.</p><p>Harlan felt his annoyance to be quite reasonable. The 2456th Century was matter-oriented, as most Centuries were, so he had a right to expect a basic compatibility from the very beginning. It would have none of the utter confusion (for anyone born matter-oriented) of the energy vortices of the 300&#x2019;s, or the field dynamics of the 600&#x2019;s. In the 2456th, to the average Eternal&#x2019;s comfort, matter was used for everything from walls to tacks.</p><p>To be sure, there was matter and matter. A member of an energy-oriented Century might not realize that. To him all matter might seem minor variations on the theme that was gross, heavy, and barbaric. To matter-oriented Harlan, however, there was wood, metal (subdivisions, heavy and light), plastic, silicates, concrete, leather, and so on.</p><p>But matter consisting entirely of mirrors!</p><p>That was his first impression of the 2456th. Every surface reflected and glinted light. Everywhere was the illusion of complete smoothness; the effect of a molecular film. And in the ever-repeated reflection of himself, of Sociologist Voy, of everything he could see, in scraps and wholes, in all angles, there was confusion. Garish confusion and nausea!</p><p>"I&#x2019;m sorry," said Voy, "it&#x2019;s the custom of the Century, and the Section assigned to it finds it good practice to adopt the customs where practical. You get used to it after a time."</p><p>Voy walked rapidly upon the moving feet of another Voy, upside down beneath the floor, who matched him stride for stride. He reached to move a hair-contact indicator down a spiral scale to point of origin.</p><p>The reflections died; extraneous light faded. Harlan felt his world settle.</p><p>"If you&#x2019;ll come with me now," said Voy.</p><p>Harlan followed through empty corridors that, Harlan knew, must moments ago have been a riot of made light and reflection, up a ramp, through an anteroom, into an office.</p><p>In all the short journey no human being had been visible. Harlan was so used to that, took it so for granted, that he would have been surprised, almost shocked, if a glimpse of a human figure hurrying away had caught his eyes. No doubt the news had spread that a Technician was coming through. Even Voy kept his distance and when, accidentally, Harlan&#x2019;s hand had brushed Voy&#x2019;s sleeve, Voy shrank away with a visible start.</p><p>Harlan was faintly surprised at the touch of bitterness he felt at this. He had thought the shell he had grown about his soul was thicker, more efficiently insensitive than that. If he was wrong, if his shell had worn thinner, there could only be one reason for that.</p><p>No�s!</p><p>Sociologist Kantor Voy leaned forward toward the Technician in what seemed a friendly enough fashion, but Harlan noted automatically that they were seated on opposite sides of the long axis of a fairly large table.</p><p>Voy said, "I am pleased to have a Technician of your reputation interest himself in our little problem here."</p><p>"Yes," said Harlan with the cold impersonality people would expect of him. "It has its points of interest." (Was he impersonal enough? Surely his real motives must be apparent, his guilt be spelled out in beads of sweat on his forehead.)</p><p>He removed from an inner pocket the foiled summary of the projected Reality Change. It was the very copy which had been sent to the Allwhen Council a month earlier. Through his relationship with Senior Computer Twissell (the Twissell, himself) Harlan had had little trouble in getting his hands on it.</p><p>Before unrolling the foil, letting it peel off onto the table top where it would be held by a soft paramagnetic field, Harlan paused a split moment.</p><p>The molecular film that covered the table was subdued but was not zero. The motion of his arm fixed his eye and for an instant the reflection of his own face seemed to stare somberly up at him from the tabletop. He was thirty-two, but he looked older. He needed no one to tell him that. It might be partly his long face and dark eyebrows over darker eyes that gave him the lowering expression and cold glare associated with the caricature of the Technician in the minds of all Eternals. It might be just his own realization that he was a Technician.</p><p>But then he flicked the foil out across the table and turned to the matter at hand.</p><p>"I am not a Sociologist, sir."</p><p>Voy smiled. "That sounds formidable. When one begins by expressing lack of competence in a given field, it usually implies that a flat opinion in that field will follow almost immediately."</p><p>"No," said Harlan, "not an opinion. Just a request. I wonder if you won&#x2019;t look over this summary and see if you haven&#x2019;t made a small mistake somewhere here."</p><p>Voy looked instantly grave. "I hope not," he said.</p><p>Harlan kept one arm across the back of his chair, the other in his lap. He must let neither hand drum restless fingers. He must not bite his lips. He must not show his feelings in any way.</p><p>Ever since the whole orientation of his life had so changed itself, he had been watching the summaries of projected Reality Changes as they passed through the grinding administrative gears of the Allwhen Council. As Senior Computer Twissell&#x2019;s personally assigned Technician, he could arrange that by a slight bending of professional ethics. Particularly with Twissell&#x2019;s attention caught ever more tightly in his own overwhelming project. (Harlan&#x2019;s nostrils flared. He knew now a little of the nature of that project.)</p><p>Harlan had had no assurance that he woul...</p></p><h2>The Rescue (The English Garden Series #2)</h2><p><p>Anne&#x2019;s father, the sword&#x2013;flourishing, full regimental&#x2013;wearing &#x201c;Colonel,&#x201d; is unwell.

Dust did tend to collect, along with dried bugs, apple seeds, and lost wisps of fog. Then she paused, which was easy to do during a dull chore like this. There was a volume on the shelf she didn't remember. That was odd, because she had an excellent memory. She had to, to be a competent Muse of History.<br><br>She lifted it up, noting the clean spot of shelf beneath it. She blew off the dust and looked at the title. She couldn't quite make it out, so she opened the volume to the title page. That was written in her handwriting, but was somehow blurred. It might be CURRENT EVENTS, but could also be GETTING EVEN. Neither one made much sense, as she did not handle either contemporary news or revenge plots. Her specialty was history, past and future. The present bored her.<br><br>She turned the pages. They had all been filled out, and definitely in her handwriting, but she couldn't read a word of it. She blinked to clear her vision, but it didn't help; every word was fuzzed. The pages might as well have been blank.<br><br>She stood there, bemused. How could she have written a volume of history that she herself couldn't read? It didn't make sense. Was she losing her sight?<br><br>Alarmed, she set the volume down and picked up the one next to it. That one was clear enough: PET PEEVE, with a picture of a disgruntled bird. That was incomplete, because it hadn't happened yet; she was working on it. So she checked the prior volume: CUBE ROUTE, which was complete. That was the story of a girl with gumption, and the text was quite clear.<br><br>So it wasn't her eyes, which was a relief. It was the volume. What was wrong with it? And why couldn't she remember writing it? How could she be writing the following volume, and remember its details, while being fuzzy on this one?<br><br>Fuzzy: her memory of it was as fuzzy as its print. There was definitely something strange here.<br><br>She considered for a good three and a half moments. She seemed to have two or more unenviable choices: principally to let the riddle be, or go to Good Magician Humfrey for advice. Humfrey could surely unravel the enigma, but would take obscene pleasure in her predicament. She hated giving him that satisfaction. But she knew the mystery would bug her until it became a downright nuisance.<br><br>She sighed. She would stuff her pride into her nonexistent handbag and go to see the Good Magician.<br><br>Humfrey's castle was some distance away from the home of the Muses, so Clio got transportation. She walked down Mount Parnassus and out to a babbling brook and spoke to it. "May I have your attention for a moment?"<br><br>The brook ceased babbling and formed a swirling eye. It looked at her, recognized her, and formed a mouth. "So good to see you, Muse," it bubbled.<br><br>"I need to pay a call on the Good Magician. Do you suppose I could prevail on you to transport me there swiftly?"<br><br>"Gladly, Muse. I owe you favors from way back."<br><br>That was true, but she hadn't cared to put it that way. "Then I should be obliged if you would run me there now."<br><br>The water humped up into a shape like that of a centaur without a human forepart, standing in the riverbed. "Immediately," it agreed. "If I can make it past the fish."<br><br>"The fish?"<br><br>"Recently there have been so many fish they clog my channel. It has never been this bad before; normally the water dragons eat them."<br><br>"The dragons must be off their feed," she said. That was humor; dragons were never off their feed. Still, it was an oddity.<br><br>Clio stepped close to the bank, glanced around to be sure no one was watching, then lifted one leg and swung it over the centaur's back. Skirts were not the most convenient clothing for riding, but they were required for her gender and age. She caught hold of the liquid creature's flowing mane and drew herself fully onto it. "I am ready."<br><br>The legs of the water horse went into instant motion. It galloped down the riverbed, following its twisting channel. It had to, because it was unable to run anywhere else. But the running water was so swift that it would soon reach the Good Magician's castle regardless of the indirectness of the route.<br><br>She looked down through the horse's translucent substance. Sure enough, the channel was packed with fish so thick it was almost solid. She looked across the landscape around the river channel, and saw rabbits in similar number; in places they were like a gray blanket covering the ground. That was another oddity; were the land dragons similarly off their feed?<br><br>She looked in the sky, and saw clouds of crows harassing the other flying creatures. Where were the flying dragons? Normally crows were hardly in evidence, because dragons toasted them on sight. Only in Mundania did they really flourish, normally.<br><br>Soon they were in sight of the castle. There was a stream access to the moat that enabled the water horse to reach it. In hardly more time that it took to see it, they were there, splashing to a halt.<br><br>The moat monster was snoozing, hardly expecting any intrusion from this direction. It lifted its head and gaped menacingly. Then it recognized the visitors, nodded, and returned to its snooze.<br><br>"I thank you kindly," Clio said, dismounting. The water horse had stopped beside a steep bank so that her foot could readily reach it. "Your swiftness was a real pleasure."<br><br>The horse nodded, dripping with pleasure. Then it galloped back the way it had come. Running water could never pause long, or it lost its definition.<br><br>A sad young woman was walking away from the castle, staring at the ground. "What's the matter?" Clio asked. "I'm Clio; maybe I can help."<br><br>"I'm Cayla. I came to ask the Good Magician what my talent is, because I haven't found it yet." She twiddled nervously with a wooden twig she carried.<br><br>"That's something you usually just have to find out on your own," Clio said. "It's almost impossible to guess."<br><br>"Yes, I've tried guessing," Cayla said. "It doesn't work." She twiddled some more; the twig was taking a beating. In fact there were two twigs getting intertwined.<br><br>"So did the Good Magician have the Answer for you?"<br><br>Cayla burst into tears. "No! I never got to see him. In fact I flunked the first Challenge."<br><br>Clio was morbidly curious. "What was it?"<br><br>"It was a big square park set on its end. That is, one corner was toward me as I came to it. I thought the challenge was to get in, but when I got in nothing happened. There was a ball flying around in there, but I had no idea what to do with it. I finally gave up." She blew her nose into a handkerchief, then returned to twiddling the twigs.<br><br>A square park, set on its end. "A diamond!" Clio said. "A baseball diamond. You weren't supposed to get 'in,' you needed to get an 'out.' By catching the ball."<br><br>Cayla looked at her. "I don't understand."<br><br>Clio realized that this would be complicated to explain. "It's only a guess." Then she noticed something. The two twigs were not just intertwined, they were knitted together. "Do you knit?"<br><br>"Yes, when I have wool."<br><br>"Have you tried knitting other things?"<br><br>"Of course not. Why would I do that?"<br><br>"Look at those twigs."<br><br>"Oh, these are nothing. I'm just frustrated and nervous."<br><br>"They are knitted together."<br><br>Cayla looked. "Why so they are. But I don't have knitting needles."<br><br>"Try something else," Clio said. She looked around and found several bricks. She picked two up. "Try these."<br><br>"Bricks? That's crazy!" But the girl took them and put them together.<br><br>The bricks twisted and merged. They were getting knitted together. "That's your talent," Clio said. "You can knit wood and bricks. Maybe other things. Maybe anything. You'll have to experiment and find out."<br><br>"Oh!" Cayla said, thrilled. "So I don't need the good Magician after all!"<br><br>"You don't," Clio agreed, pleased. This was her first personal interaction with a human person in regular Xanth in some time, and she was glad it had been positive.<br><br>"Thank you so much! I was so sad; now I'm so happy." Cayla ran on along the path.<br><br>Clio walked toward the drawbridge. This was the obvious way to cross the moat, as she didn't wish to get her feet or skirt wet. But as she approached it, it lifted off the bank, being drawn up by its chains.<br><br>"Halt!" she cried. "I wish to use you."<br><br>The bridge halted.<br><br>She arrived at its resting spot. "Now if you will just drop back down to the bank, I shall be happy to set foot on your sturdy surface," she said.<br><br>The bridge started to drop, but a chain snarled and it got hung up. It was stuck a small but inconvenient distance above the ground.<br><br>Clio considered it, an unbecoming suspicion hovering at the fringe of her awareness. It wasn't like the Good Magician to have flawed mechanisms. Was it possible that this was not a malfunction? That she was being subjected to a Challenge for entry?<br><br>No, of course not; she couldn't believe that of her old friend Humfrey. So it must be a rare glitch in the mechanism.<br><br>"Hello the castle!" she called. "You appear to have a problem. The drawbridge is stuck."<br><br>There was a little shed associated with the near side of the drawbridge. Now the bridge tender emerged. "Harold the Handyman here. What can I do for you?"<br><br>"I am Clio, the Muse of History. I wish to confer with the Good Magician Humfrey, but am unable to cross the moat. Can you fix the connection?"<br><br>"Sure, I'll be glad to lend a hand," Handy said, extending his right hand.<br><br>She took it. "Excellent. The lines seem to be snarled, so---EEEEEK!" Her scream was a full five E's, and would have been six, had she not run out of breath.<br><br>For the man's left hand had just reached around and goosed her right through her skirt.<br><br>"Oh, I'm so sorry," Harold said, hastily retreating. "I forget to warn you. I have two hands."<br><br>"I appreciate that," she said somewhat coldly as she rubbed her indignant bottom.<br><br>"I mean, they're different. My right hand helps others, but my wrong hand roves. I can't stop them."<br><br>She saw his problem. "Perhaps the Good Magician can help you with that problem."<br><br>"Maybe, after I complete my year of service."<br><br>"I should think he would fix the problem first, to better enable you to perform your service effectively."<br><br>"Not exactly. This is my service."<br><br>"Tending the drawbridge," she agreed.<br><br>"No. Being a Challenge."<br><br>She gazed at him. "You are a Challenge?"<br><br>"That's right. Any querent has to navigate three Challenges before getting into the castle to query the Good Magician. He doesn't like to be bothered by folk who aren't serious."<br><br>"I know that. But I'm not a querent; I'm his friend!"<br><br>"You're coming to ask his advice."<br><br>The hovering suspicion abruptly landed. She was indeed being subjected to the Challenges. That was as outrageous to her mind as was the goose to her bottom. "Well, I never!"<br><br>"My right hand should be able to fix the drawbridge," Handy said. "But my wrong hand will interfere. So I have to deal with my hands before I can deal with the problem."<br><br>"And I am expected to fathom how to resolve your problem of hands," Clio said. "As the first of my Challenges."<br><br>"You catch on quickly," the man agreed.<br><br>She was tempted to think an unkind thought about Humfrey, who was definitely not acting in a friendly manner. The very idea that she should be subjected to this process! He deserved to receive a sour piece of her mind. But unkindness was not in her nature, so she realized in half a moment that this was probably a confusion on Humfrey's part, an error. He used water from the Fountain of Youth to prevent himself from aging beyond a hundred years, and perhaps needed to set the mark a bit younger, to prevent senility. She would suggest that to him, as he surely did not want to be confusing his friends with querents.<br><br>But first she had to get in to see him. Well, then, there was no help for it but to tackle the three Challenges, preposterous as the situation was.<br><br>She looked at Harold the Handyman. So he had a right hand and a wrong hand. Her challenge was to discover a way to nullify the wrong one, so that he could let the right one function. She doubted that any permanent solution was within her power, as she was a Historian, not a Magician, but perhaps there could be a temporary expedient. One that would enable him to function during the interim of his Service to the Good Magician.<br><br>"I am neither a Magician nor a Doctor," she said. "So I am unable to offer a cure for your condition. But I may have a way to negate enough of its effect to enable you to perform satisfactorily."<br><br>"That would be great," Handy said.<br><br>"I believe you should identify your hands. The right one can be called Dexter, and the wrong one can be called Sinister. Put labels on them to that all who encounter you will know them well enough to be able to avoid mischief."<br><br>"That sounds great," he said. "Forewarned is foreordained."<br><br>"Forearmed," she said.<br><br>"Whatever." He fetched some sticky labels and a pen. But when his right hand tried to write on them, his wrong hand jerked the paper out from under the pen.<br><br>"Let me see if I can do that," Clio said, smiling. She took pen and paper and neatly printed DEXTER and SINISTER. "Now hold out your hands."<br><br>Handy's right hand cooperated, and she fastened its label to the back of it. But the wrong hand jerked away, raising a middle finger. A cloudlet of smoke formed around it, suggesting that this was not a nice gesture. It didn't want to be labeled.<br><br>She tried to catch it, but it dodged aside, avoiding her. Then she had a naughty idea. She stood straight, half turning away. "Very well, if I can't label you, I will go elsewhere."<br><br>The wrong hand couldn't resist. It dived in for another goose. But as it touched her skirt, she slapped the label against it. Now the hand was marked despite itself.<br><br>"You got it!" Handy exclaimed.<br><br>"Well, I should hope to be able to outsmart a mere hand." She was privately pleased despite the embarrassing touch. She had, as it were, gotten to the bottom of the problem.<br><br>The hand was so ashamed of being tricked that it hid behind the man's back. That allowed the right hand to reach up and unsnarl the lines, and the drawbridge dropped to its proper landing. She had navigated the first Challenge.<br><br>At the far end of the bridge was a gate with an oddly folded turnstile. In fact it was shaped like the letter W. Clio paused to examine it. If this was a Challenge, its operation was obscure. It was mounted on a post that allowed it to rotate, so that it should be possible to step into one of the indents and circle through to the other side. What was supposed to be so difficult about that? She was not a suspicious woman, but she distrusted this.<br><br>Still, there seemed to be no other way to proceed. She stepped into it, put her hand on an end, and pushed. It turned, briefly enclosing her as she passed through the gate, then releasing her the other side. No problem at all.<br><br>She turned to glance back---and saw another woman right behind her. She looked rather familiar. In fact she looked exactly like Clio herself in the mirror. Where had she come from? She had not been on the bridge.<br><br>"Get out of my way, witch," the woman snapped.<br><br>Clio stepped out of her way, affronted. "Who, if I may be so bold as to ask, are you?"<br><br>"Who do you think I am, idiot? I'm your double, Oilc."<br><br>"My double! How can that be?"<br><br>"Didn't you just pass through the Double-You?

And Paris was left to figure out how she intended to get through the next day, let alone the rest of her life.<br><br>The task could not have been more painful. First came the tears.

The weather was perfect, winter had vanished literally overnight, birds were singing, the sun was warm, and everything in the Armstrongs' Connecticut garden was in bloom. The entire week had been blessed with the kind of weather that made everyone slow down, even in New York. Couples strolled, lunch hours stretched. People smiled. And in Greenwich that night, Paris Armstrong decided to serve dinner outside on the flagstone patio they had just redone near the pool. She and Peter were giving a dinner party on a Friday night, which was rare for them. They did most of their entertaining on Saturday, so Peter didn't have to rush home from work in the city on Friday night. But the caterers had only been available on this particular Friday. They had weddings booked for every Saturday night through July. It was harder for Peter, but he'd been a good sport when she told him about the Friday night plan. Peter indulged her most of the time, he always had. He liked making life easy for her. It was one of the myriad things she loved about him. <br><br>They had just celebrated their twenty-fourth anniversary in March. It was hard to believe sometimes how the years had flown by and how full they had been. Megan, their eldest, had graduated from Vassar the year before, and at twenty-three, she had recently taken a job in L.A. She was interested in all aspects of film and had landed a job as a production assistant with a movie studio in Hollywood. She was barely more than a gofer, as she admitted openly, but she was thrilled with just being there, and wanted to be a producer one day. William, their son, had just turned eighteen, and was graduating in June. He was going to UC Berkeley in the fall. It was hard to believe that their kids were grown. It seemed only minutes before that she had been changing diapers and carpooling, taking Meg to ballet, and Wim to hockey games. And in three months he'd be gone. He was due in Berkeley the week before the Labor Day weekend.<br><br>Paris made sure that the table had been set properly. The caterers were reliable and had a good eye. They knew her kitchen well. She and Peter liked to entertain, and Paris used them frequently. They enjoyed their social life and over the years they had collected an eclectic assortment of interesting friends. She set the flowers that she had arranged herself on the table. She had cut a profusion of multicolored peonies, the tablecloth was immaculate, and the crystal and silver gleamed. Peter probably wouldn't notice, especially if he was tired when he got home, but what he sensed more than saw was the kind of home she provided him with. Paris was impeccable about details. She created an atmosphere of warmth and elegance that people flourished in. She did it not only for him and their friends but for herself as well.<br><br>Peter provided handsomely for her too. He'd been generous with her and the children. He had been very successful over the years. He was a partner in a lucrative law firm, specializing in corporate accounts, and at fifty-one, he was the managing partner. The house he'd bought for them ten years before was large and beautiful. It was a handsome stone house, in one of the more luxurious neighborhoods in Greenwich, Connecticut. They'd talked about hiring a decorator, but in the end she had decided to decorate it herself, and loved doing it. Peter was thrilled with the results. They also had one of the prettiest gardens in Greenwich. She'd done such a great job with the house that he had often teased her and told her she should become a decorator, and most people who saw the house agreed. But although artistic, her interests had always been similar to his.<br><br>She had a solid respect and understanding for the business world. They had married as soon as she graduated from college, and she had gone to business school and graduated with an MBA. She had wanted to start a small business of her own, but got pregnant in her second year of business school, and had decided to stay home with their children instead. And she'd never had any regrets. Peter supported her in her decision, there was no need for her to work. And for twenty-four years, she had felt competent and fulfilled, devoting herself full time to Peter and their children. She baked cookies, organized school fairs, ran the school auction every year, made costumes by hand at Halloween, spent countless hours at the orthodontist with them, and generally did what many other wives and mothers did. She didn't need an MBA for any of it, but her extensive understanding of the corporate world, and her lively interest in it made it a lot easier when talking to Peter late at night about the cases he was working on. If anything, it even made them closer. She was, and had been, the perfect wife for him, and he had profound respect for the way she had brought up their children. She had turned out to be everything he had expected her to be--and Paris was equally pleased with him.<br><br>They still shared laughter on Sunday mornings, as they snuggled beneath the covers for an extra half-hour on cold wintry days. And she still got up with him at the crack of dawn every weekday, and drove him to the train, and then came back to take the kids to school, until they were old enough to drive themselves, which had come far too quickly for her. And the only dilemma she had now was trying to figure out what she was going to do with herself when Wim left for Berkeley in August. She could no longer imagine a life without teenagers splashing in the pool in summer, or turning the house upside down as they overflowed the downstairs playroom on the weekends. For twenty-three of the twenty-four years of her marriage, her life had entirely and unreservedly revolved around them. And it saddened her to know that those days were almost over for good.<br><br>She knew that once Wim left for college, life as she had known it for so long would be over. He would come home for the occasional weekend, and holidays, as Meg had while she was at Vassar, only less so because he would be so far away, on the West Coast. Once Meg had graduated, she had all but disappeared. She had gone to New York for six months, moved into an apartment with three friends, and then left for California as soon as she found the job she wanted in L.A. From now on, they would see her on Thanksgiving and Christmas, if they were lucky, and God only knew what would happen once she got married, not that she had any plans. Paris knew only too well that in August, when Wim left, her life would be forever changed.<br><br>After twenty-four years out of the job market, she couldn't exactly head for New York and go to work. She'd been baking cookies and driving carpools for too long. The only thing she had thought of doing so far was volunteer work in Stamford, working with abused kids, or on a literacy program a friend of hers had started in the public schools for underprivileged high school students who had managed to get most of the way through high school and could barely read. Beyond that, she had no idea what she was going to do with herself. Peter had told her years before that once the kids left, it would be a great opportunity for them to travel together, and to do things they had never been able to do before. But his work hours had stretched so noticeably in the last year, she thought it unlikely he would be able to get away. He rarely even made it home for dinner anymore. From what Paris could see, for the moment at least, both of her children and her husband had busy, productive lives, and she didn't. And she knew she had to do something about it soon. The prospect of the vast amount of free time she was about to have on her hands was beginning to frighten her. She had talked to Peter about it on several occasions, and he had no useful suggestions to make. He told her she'd figure it out sooner or later, and she knew she would. At forty-six, she was young enough to start a career if she wanted to, the problem was that she didn't know what she wanted to do. She liked things the way they were, taking care of her children and husband, and attending to their every need on the weekends--particularly Peter's. Unlike some of her friends, whose marriages had shown signs of strain over the years, or even ruptured entirely, Paris was still in love with him. He was kinder, gentler, more considerate, in fact he was more sophisticated and seasoned, and even better looking than he had been when they got married. And he always said the same about her.<br><br>Paris was slim and lithe and athletic. Once the children were older and she had more free time, she played tennis almost every day, and was in terrific shape. She wore her straight blond hair long, and most of the time wore it pulled back in a braid. She had classic Grace Kelly good looks, and green eyes. Her figure was noteworthy, her laughter easy, and her sense of humor quick to ignite, much to the delight of her friends. She used to love playing practical jokes, which never failed to amuse her children. Peter was far quieter by nature, and always had been. By the time he came home at night after a long day and the commute on the train, more often than not, he was too tired to do much more than listen to her, and make the occasional comment. He came to life more on the weekends, but even then he was quiet and somewhat reserved. And in the last year he had been consumed with work. This was, in fact, the first dinner party they had given in three months. He had worked late every Friday night, and gone back into town some Saturdays, to clear things off his desk, or meet with clients. But Paris was always patient about it. She made few demands on him, and had a profound respect for his diligence about his work. It was what made him so good at what he did, and so highly admired in business and legal circles. She couldn't fault him for being conscientious, although she missed spending more time with him. Particularly now, with Meg gone for the past six months, and Wim busy with his own life and friends in the final weeks of his senior year. Peter's heavy workload in recent months reminded her yet again that she was going to have to find something to occupy her time in September. She had even thought of starting a catering business, or investing in a nursery, since she enjoyed her garden so much. But the catering business, she knew, would interfere with her time with Peter on the weekends, and she wanted to be available to him whenever he was home, which was seldom enough these days.<br><br>She took a shower and dressed after checking the table and cruising through the kitchen to check on the caterers, and everything seemed in good order. They were having five couples for dinner, all of them good friends. She was looking forward to it, and hoped Peter would get home in time to unwind before the guests arrived. She was thinking of him, when Wim stuck his head in her bedroom door while she was getting dressed. He wanted to tell her his plans, a house rule she rigidly enforced even at his age. She wanted to know where her children were at all times, and with whom. Paris was the consummate responsible mother and devoted wife. Everything in her life was in perfect order, and relatively good control.<br><br>"I'm going over to the Johnsons' with Matt," Wim said, glancing at her, as she pulled up the side zipper of a white lace skirt. She was already wearing a strapless tube top to match, and high-heeled silver sandals.<br><br>"Are you staying there, or going somewhere else afterward?" She smiled at him. He was a handsome boy, and looked like his father. Wim had been six feet three by the time he reached fifteen, and had grown another inch since. He had his father's dark brown hair and piercing blue eyes, and he smiled as he looked at his mother. Wim thought she always looked pretty, when she got dressed up, and he watched as she wound her long blond hair into a bun as they talked. He always thought his mother had a simple elegance about her, and he was as proud of her as she was of him. He was not only a good student, but had been a star athlete all through high school. "Are you going to a party tonight?" Paris asked wisely. For the past month at least, if not two, the seniors had been kicking up their heels, and Wim was always in the thick of things. Girls were crazy about him, and drawn to him like a magnet, although he had been going out with the same girl since Christmas, and Paris liked her. She was a nice girl from a wholesome family in Greenwich. Her mother was a teacher, and her father a doctor.<br><br>"Yeah, we might go to a party later. "He looked momentarily sheepish. She knew him too well. He had been thinking of not telling her about it. She always asked so many questions. He and his sister both complained about it, but in another sense, they liked it. There was never any question about how much she loved them.<br><br>"Whose house?" she asked, as she finished her hair and put on just a dash of blush and lipstick.<br><br>"The Steins'," Wim said with a grin. She always asked. Always. And he knew before she said it what the next question would be.<br><br>"Will the parents be there?" Even at eighteen, she didn't want him at unsupervised parties. It was an invitation to trouble, and when they were younger, she had called to verify it herself. In the past year, she had finally relented, and was willing to take Wim's word. But there were still incidents now and then when he tried to pull the wool over her eyes. As she said, it was his job to try and put one over on her, and hers to figure it out when he did. She was pretty good about sussing things out, and most of the time he was honest, and she was comfortable about where he went.</p><h2>The Parable of the Pipeline: How Anyone Can Build a Pipeline of Ongoing Residual Income in the New Economy</h2><p>The Parable Of The Pipeline will teach you how to build pipelines of steady flowing income so that you can make the leap from earning a living today...to enjoying a lifestyle tomorrow!</p><p></p><h2>Thai Women in the Global Labor Force: Consuming Desires, Contested Selves</h2><p>Most research on female labor migration in Thailand focuses on that country's infamous sex industry. Mary Beth Mills offers the first extended ethnographic analysis of rural women's movement into less visible occupations, paying particular attention to the hundreds of thousands of young women who fill the factories and sweatshops of the Bangkok metropolis. Mills follows the women as they travel from the village of Baan Naa Sakae to Bangkok, where they encounter new forms of consumption, new "modern" lifestyles, and a new sense of identity. She finds this rural-urban migration is more than a simple economic activity, but rather an elaborate process of cultural change.<br><br>Mills describes the environments from which these women left, as well as the urban landscape they now call home. Hence, she examines key aspects of rural Thai community life, such as local consumption practices, gender roles, and the familial tensions that are often the catalyst to labor migration. Then she focuses on the city and the underlying tensions of urban employment as migrants pursue newly imagined identities as modern women, while still upholding economic and moral responsibilities to rural kin.<br></p><p>Most research on the female labor force in Thailand focuses on that country's infamous sex industry.

Yet religion lies at the heart of American politics. How did America become a nation with the soul of a church? In Hellfire Nation, James Morone recasts American history as a moral epic. From the colonial era to the present day, Americans embraced a Providential mission, tangled with devils, and aspired to save the world. Moral fervor ignited our fiercest social conflicts&#x2014;but it also moved dreamers to remake the nation in the name of social justice. Moral crusades inspired abolition, woman suffrage, and civil rights, even as they led Americans to hang witches, enslave Africans, and ban liquor. Today these moral arguments continue, influencing the debate over everything from abortion to foreign policy. Written with passion and deep insight, Hellfire Nation tells the story of a brawling, raucous, religious people. Morone shows how fears of sin and dreams of virtue defined the shape of the nation.</p><p>James A. Morone, professor of political science at Brown University, is also the author of The Democratic Wish: Popular Participation and the Limits of American Government.Almost 60 years after Gunnar Myrdal argued that America's distinctive moral consciousness might prove "the salvation of mankind," Morone finds that same characteristic at least as likely to legitimate invidious discrimination as to inspire utopian strivings. As he probes the sermonizing style of moral politics that has so profoundly shaped America, Morone highlights two contrasting impulses: a Victorian censoriousness and a Social Gospel communalism. The narrative first traces the Victorian impulse--arising from Puritan fears of witchcraft and debauchery--as it inspires the fervor of nineteenth-century abolitionists and twentieth-century prohibitionists. Later, readers witness the emergence of a long nascent Social Gospel--springing from Puritan pledges of mutual love--as it stirs the visionary hopes behind the New Deal and the civil rights movement. Though a partisan of Social Gospel politics and a critic of Victorian conservatism, Morone illuminates the complexities in both impulses. Readers trying to peer into the nation's post-9/11 moral future will thank Morone for clarifying the path along which righteous fervor has already impelled us. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It engages the reader with a rigorous theological discussion which is thought provoking yet mentally taxing. At times he lapses into hair-splitting minutae in examining theological issues, and the result is what the author himself admitted was a &#34;sometimes tortuous argument&#34;. However, I would still recommend this one to anyone who wants to go right after the meat of Alan Watts&#39; theology, or for those who wish read stuff from his earlier Christian stage as opposed to his later works, when he dealt almost exclusively with Eastern religion. The Supreme Identity is probably watt&#39;s most enlightening work. it will be outright rejected and considered dangerous by probably most religious minded folks but that will only serve to make it more interesting to anyone who is ready for it&#39;s message. if you feel that religion in its current form is simply too small minded and practically irrelevant but don&#39;t know exactly why, then read this book. watts is not anti-religion by any means. But he courageously and clearly sets forth the truth of the human/divine continuum by elucidating the essence of vedantist realization. he uses clear and plain language with that wry humor that endeared him to so many. In this book, Watts took Oneness to an extreme where good and evil seemed to meet. He was trying to describe the Vedantic idea of Oneness. I realized I preferred to think of the One as Good, not beyond good and evil. It was an idea of God I would not let go of, and it became a turning point in my life. I realized I was of the West, and it was in the West I would find my way of God.</p><p></p><h2>Treehouses of the World</h2><p>A leading authority on treehouse design takes readers on an around-the-world journey of treehouses, discussing how they are designed, built, and enjoyed in numerous cultures, in a volume that showcases thirty-five treehouses and discusses their role in environmentalism. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Pete Nelson is the author of three previous books on treehouses. He is also principal of Treehouse Workshop, Inc., a treehouse design and construction business in Seattle, and the president of his own residential design and construction firm based in Fall City, Washington.A principal of the Seattle-based construction company Treehouse Workshop and the author of three previous treehouse books, Nelson can safely be said to be solidly grounded in his knowledge of the subject; he presents everything from elevated basic wooden shelters to California-style ranches to turreted abodes resembling that of Pip's friend Wemmick in <i>Great Expectations</i>&#x2014;fanciful and Victorian. The 250 full-color photos from Kurzaj (<i>The Abrams Guide to American Houses</i>) show great sympathy and felicity of composition, invitingly maximizing the natural settings. While the title promises diversity, about half of the houses are in the United States (with a West Coast majority built by Nelson), a quarter or so in Europe and most of the rest in Japan. And materials and location do dictate a certain uniformity&#x2014;the houses are not as different on first and second look as one would expect. But Nelson's knowledgeability about modes of design and construction come through in colloquial, first-person text that includes short bios of the various houses' part-time inhabitants, and, if he did the building, Nelson's role in making them happen. The lovely photos and thoughtful layout complete the feel of climbing up to an alternative aerial domicile as one turns the pages. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I couldn&#x2019;t revive him if I would, at least not for years,&#x201d; he wrote to a friend, for I have had such an overdose of him that I feel towards him as I do towards <i>p�t�-de-foie-gras</i>, of which I once ate too much, so that the name of it gives me a sickly feeling to this day&#x201d; (Baring-Gould, <i>The Annotated Sherlock Holmes</i>, vol. 1, p. 16; see For Further Reading&#x201d;). Then seven years later, after a young friend told him a legend from Dartmoor about a supernatural hound, Conan Doyle relented by writing <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>. He was careful, however, to make it a reminiscence, not a resurrection, of his famous consulting detective. The story was set in 1889, two years before the Swiss misadventure. The resumption of writing about his most famous creation must have set into motion something in Conan Doyle&#x2019;s soul, for in an interview quoted in the <i>Harper&#x2019;s Weekly</i> issue of August 31, 1901, the month <i>The Hound </i>was first serialized, one can see his resolve starting to weaken. I know that my friend Dr. Watson is a most trustworthy man, and I gave the utmost credit to his story of the dreadful affair in Switzerland. He may have been mistaken, of course. It may not have been Mr. Holmes who fell from the ledge at all, or the whole affair might be the result of hallucination.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t long before Conan Doyle decided perhaps after a wistful look at his bank balance that the enforced absence of his sleuth had gone on for too long. In 1903 he called on his friend Dr. Watson once more for another series of stories about his colleague, and in October 1903 the <i>Strand</i> published The Adventure of the Empty House.&#x201d; There it was revealed, almost plausibly, that only Moriarty had gone over the falls at Reichenbach. Thus readers learned to their delight that they would be treated to many more adventures of the world&#x2019;s greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A series of twelve more stories followed, ending with The Adventure of the Second Stain,&#x201d; the last published in the December 1904 issue of the <i>Strand Magazine</i>. In quick order the series was published as a book by George Newnes of London in 1905, under the title <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes,</i> with sixteen illustrations by Sidney Paget, the great illustrator whose drawings for the first <i>Strand</i> stories had done so much to establish the popular image of Holmes. The new stories appeared to take up just where the old ones left off. Holmes and Watson resumed their cozy relationship; Holmes continued to solve mysteries that baffled Watson, Scotland Yard, and the reader; and the world of 221B Baker Street seemed as solid and unchanging as ever.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that way only until one examines the stories more carefully. A closer reading reveals subtle but significant changes in Holmes. The first one we might notice is Holmes&#x2019;s willingness to take the law into his own hands. In one of the early Sherlock Holmes stories, The Boscombe Valley Mystery,&#x201d; we recall that Holmes did not divulge the name of John Turner as the man responsible for the death of his neighbor, Mr. McCarthy, when Holmes learned that McCarthy was a blackmailer and that Turner didn&#x2019;t have long to live. Technically it&#x2019;s a crime to conceal such evidence, but in view of the circumstances few would quarrel with Holmes&#x2019;s decision. But before his resurrection, such behavior by Holmes was unique to that story, and we might note that he merely withheld information he had deduced himself passive misbehavior at worst. In his defense we might also recall that in the case of The Greek Interpreter&#x201d; in the second series of stories, Holmes insisted on getting a warrant to search the premises of kidnappers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>The Return</i> such niceties are almost scornfully dismissed. Holmes aggressively pursues his own justice, actively breaking the law on several occasions and coming close to morally censurable conduct on several others. We first see this change in The Adventure of the Priory School,&#x201d; where we learn that the murder of a German teacher named Heidegger and the kidnapping of the son of the Duke of Holdernesse were part of a plot by the duke&#x2019;s illegitimate son. It&#x2019;s clear that the son, acting as the duke&#x2019;s secretary, and the duke himself were complicit in aiding the killer&#x2019;s escape. Holmes, claiming he is a poor man, agrees to keep silent about the whole nasty business in exchange for a huge check from his lordship. This is rather shocking. Unlike the previous case in Boscombe Valley, where we feel some sympathy for the wronged man, who will die soon anyway, we have no extenuating circumstances here. In fact, we have a prime example of the high-handedness of aristocracy in covering up its dirty family business at the cost of other people&#x2019;s lives. Holmes&#x2019;s acceptance of an enormous check could be seen as a bribe. When we compare this with his acid-toned retort in The Problem of Thor Bridge,&#x201d; My professional charges are upon a fixed scale,&#x2019; said Holmes coldly. I do not vary them, save when I remit them altogether&#x2019;&#x201d; it looks as if Holmes has sold out here.</p></p><h2>Flutterby (Serendipity Series)</h2><p>Flutterby finds out what she is by painful trial and error.</p><p></p><h2>The Superior Spider-Man 6: Goblin Nation</h2><p>The so-called Superior Spider-Man has failed.

Now, with one semester of high school to go, and no obstacles between him and out-of-state college freedom, Tanner plans to coast through his remaining classes and clear out of Utah. But when his best friend Autumn dares him to take Provo High&#39;s prestigious Seminar-where honor roll students diligently toil to draft a book in a semester-Tanner can&#39;t resist going against his better judgment and having a go, if only to prove to Autumn how silly the whole thing is. Writing a book in four months sounds simple. Four months is an eternity. It turns out, Tanner is only partly right: four months is a long time. After all, it takes only one second for him to notice Sebastian Brother, the Mormon prodigy who sold his own Seminar novel the year before and who now mentors the class.

We&#x2019;re seven semesters into our high school career, with one last&#x2014;token, honestly&#x2014;semester to go. I want to celebrate like your average guy: with some private time and a few mindless hours down the YouTube rabbit hole. Unfortunately, neither of those things is going to happen.<br> <br>Because, from across her bed, Autumn is glaring at me, waiting for me to explain myself.<br> <br>My schedule isn&#x2019;t complete and classes start up in two days and the good ones fill up fast and This is just so like you, Tanner.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not that she&#x2019;s wrong. It is just like me. But I can&#x2019;t help it if she&#x2019;s the ant and I&#x2019;m the grasshopper in this relationship. That&#x2019;s the way it&#x2019;s always been.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; she repeats, tossing her pencil down. &#x201c;You should have that printed on a T-shirt.&#x201d;<br> <br>Autumn is my rock, my safe place, the best of my best&#x2014;but when it comes to school, she is unbelievably anal-retentive. I roll onto my back, staring up at her ceiling from her bed. For her birthday sophomore year&#x2014;right after I moved here and she took me under her wing&#x2014;I gave her a poster of a kitten diving into a tub of fuzzy balls. To this day, the poster remains sturdily taped there. It&#x2019;s a super-cute cat, but by junior year I think the innocent sweetness of it had been slowly sullied by its inherent weirdness. So, over the motivational phrase DIVE RIGHT IN, KITTY! I taped four Post-it notes with what I think the creator of the poster might have intended it to say: DON&#x2019;T BE A PUSSY!<br> <br>She must agree with the edit because she&#x2019;s left it up there.<br> <br>I turn my head to gaze over at her. &#x201c;Why are you worried? It&#x2019;s my schedule.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not worried,&#x201d; she says, crunching down on a stack of crackers. &#x201c;But you know how fast things fill up. I don&#x2019;t want you to end up with Hoye for O Chem because he gives twice as much homework and that will cut into my social life.&#x201d;<br> <br>This is a half-truth. Getting Hoye for chem would cut into her social life&#x2014;I&#x2019;m the one with the car; I chauffer her around most of the time&#x2014;but what Autumn really hates is that I leave things to the last minute and then manage to get what I want anyway. We&#x2019;re both good students in our own way. We&#x2019;re both high honor roll, and we both killed our ACTs. But where Autumn with homework is a dog with a bone, I&#x2019;m more like a cat lying in a sunny window; if the homework is within reach and doing something interesting, I&#x2019;ll happily charm it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, your social life is our priority.&#x201d; I shift my weight, brushing away a trail of cracker crumbs stuck to my forearm. They&#x2019;ve left a mark there, tiny red indentations in the skin, the same way gravel might. She could stand to spread some of her obsessiveness to room cleaning. &#x201c;Autumn, my God. You&#x2019;re a pig. Look at this bed.&#x201d;<br> <br>She responds to this by shoving another stack of Ritz in her mouth, crumbling another trail onto her Wonder Woman sheets. Her reddish hair is in a messy pile on her head, and she&#x2019;s wearing the same Scooby-Doo pajamas she&#x2019;s had since she was fourteen. They still fit . . . mostly.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you ever get Eric in here,&#x201d; I say, &#x201c;he&#x2019;ll be horrified.&#x201d;<br> <br>Eric is another one of our friends and one of only a handful of non-Mormon kids in our grade. I guess technically Eric is Mormon, or at least his parents are. They&#x2019;re what most people would call &#x201c;Jack Mormon.&#x201d; They drink (both alcohol and caffeine) but are still reasonably involved in the church. Best of both worlds, he says&#x2014;although it&#x2019;s easy to see that the other Latter-day Saints students at Provo High don&#x2019;t agree. When it comes to social circles, Jack Mormon is the same as not Mormon at all. Like me.<br> <br>A few dry flecks of cracker fly out when Autumn coughs at this, feigning repulsion. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want Eric anywhere near my bed.&#x201d;<br> <br>And yet here I am, lying on her bed. It&#x2019;s a testament to how much her mother trusts me that I&#x2019;m allowed in her room at all. But maybe Mrs. Green senses already that nothing will happen in here between me and Auddy.<br> <br>We did that once, over winter break our sophomore year. I&#x2019;d lived in Provo for only five months by that point, but there was an immediate chemistry between us&#x2014;driven by a lot of classes in common and a comfort from our shared defector status with the Mormon kids at school. Unfortunately, the chemistry dissolved for me when things got physical, and by some miracle we dodged the post-make-out awkward bullet. I am not willing to risk it again.<br> <br>She seems to grow hyperaware of our proximity at the same moment I do, straightening and pulling her pajamas down her torso. I push up so I&#x2019;m sitting, leaning against the headboard: a safer position. &#x201c;Who do you have for first?&#x201d;<br> <br>Autumn looks down at her schedule. &#x201c;Polo. Modern Lit.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Same.&#x201d; I steal a cracker, and&#x2014;like a civilized human&#x2014;manage to eat it without dropping a crumb. Scanning down my paper with an index finger, I feel pretty good about this last term. &#x201c;Honestly, my schedule isn&#x2019;t too bad. I only need to add something for fourth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you can add the Seminar.&#x201d; Autumn claps joyfully.<br> <br>Her eyes are flashlights, beaming their thrill into the dusky room: She has wanted to take this course since she was a freshman.<br> <br>The Seminar&#x2014;I&#x2019;m serious; when the school references it in newsletters or announcements, they even capitalize it like that&#x2014;is so pretentious it&#x2019;s unreal. WRITE A BOOK IN A SEMESTER, the catalog cheerfully dares, as if that could happen only in this class. As if the average person couldn&#x2019;t throw together enough words in four months. Four months is a lifetime.<br> <br>Students who apply need to have completed at least one advanced placement English course and have a minimum of a 3.75 GPA for the previous term. Even if that includes seventy kids in our grade alone, the teacher only enrolls fourteen.<br> <br>Two years ago, the New York Times wrote an article and called it &#x201c;a brilliantly ambitious course, earnestly and diligently directed by the NYT-bestselling faculty member Tim Fujita.&#x201d; (I know that direct quote because the piece was printed out, enlarged to about five thousand times the original size, and framed in the front office. My frequent gripe is the criminal overuse of adverbs, which Autumn thinks makes me petty.) Last year, a senior named Sebastian Brother took the Seminar, and some big publisher bought his manuscript. I don&#x2019;t even know who he is and I&#x2019;ve heard his story a hundred times: He&#x2019;s a bishop&#x2019;s son! He wrote a high fantasy novel! Apparently, it was amazing. Mr. Fujita sent it to an agent, who sent it to people in New York, and there was some sort of civilized warfare for it, and boom, now he&#x2019;s across the street at BYU and apparently delaying his mission so that he can do a book tour and become the next Tolkien.<br> <br>Or L. Ron Hubbard. Though I guess some Mormons might take issue with that comparison. They don&#x2019;t like to be lumped in with cults like Scientology. Then again, neither do Scientologists.<br> <br>Anyway, now&#x2014;other than BYU football and the sea of Mormons&#x2014;the Seminar is the only thing anyone ever talks about anymore when they mention Provo.<br> <br>&#x201c;You got in?&#x201d; I confirm, not that I&#x2019;m surprised. This class means everything to Autumn, and apart from already meeting the actual requirements, she&#x2019;s been devouring novels nonstop in the hope that she&#x2019;ll get a chance to write her own.<br> <br>She nods. Her smile stretches from sea to shining sea.<br> <br>&#x201c;Badass.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You could, too, if you talked to Mr. Fujita,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You have the grades. You&#x2019;re a good writer. Plus, he loves your parents.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nah.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m expecting acceptance letters to colleges anywhere but here&#x2014;Mom begged me to only apply out of state&#x2014;and a yes from any one of those schools will be conditional on my grades this last semester. Regardless of how easy I think this might be, this is not the time to be taking chances.<br> <br>Autumn picks at a beleaguered fingernail. &#x201c;Because then you&#x2019;d have to, you know, finish something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I finished your mom earlier. I think you know what I mean.&#x201d;<br> <br>She pulls my leg hair, and I screech out a surprisingly feminine sound.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tanner,&#x201d; she says, sitting up, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious. It would be good for you. You should take this class with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You say that like I would want to.&#x201d;<br> <br>Glaring at me, she growls, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Seminar, asshole. Everyone wants to.&#x201d;<br> <br>See what I mean? She&#x2019;s got this course on a pedestal, and it&#x2019;s so nerdy it makes me a little protective of Future Autumn, when she&#x2019;s out in the world, battling her Hermione Nerd Girl battles. I give her my best smile. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you worried about coming up with something original?&#x201d; she asks. &#x201c;I could help you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on. I moved here when I was fifteen&#x2014;which I think we can agree is the worst time to move from Palo Alto, California, to Provo, Utah&#x2014;with a mouth full of metal and no friends. I have stories.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not to mention I&#x2019;m a half-Jewish queer kid in a straight and Mormon town.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t say that last part, not even to Autumn. It wasn&#x2019;t that big a deal in Palo Alto when, at thirteen, I realized I liked the idea of kissing guys as much as kissing girls. Here, it would be a huge deal. She&#x2019;s the best of my best, yeah, but I don&#x2019;t want to risk telling her and finding out she&#x2019;s only progressive in theory and not when a queer kid is hanging out in her bedroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;We all had braces, and you had me.&#x201d; She flops back on her bed. &#x201c;Besides, everyone hates being fifteen, Tanner. It&#x2019;s period emergencies and boners at the pool, zits and angst and unclear social protocol. I guarantee ten out of fifteen students in this class will write about the perils of high school for lack of deeper sources of fiction.&#x201d;<br> <br>A quick scan through the Rolodex of my past gives me a lurching, defensive feeling in my gut, like maybe she&#x2019;s right. Maybe I couldn&#x2019;t come up with something interesting and deep, and fiction must come from depth. I&#x2019;ve got two supportive&#x2014;maybe overly supportive&#x2014;parents, a crazy but wonderful extended family, a not-too-terrible-although-dramatically-emo sister, my own car. I haven&#x2019;t known a lot of turmoil.<br> <br>So I balk, pinching the back of her thigh. &#x201c;What makes you so deep?&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a joke, of course. Autumn has plenty to write about. Her dad died in Afghanistan when she was nine. Afterward, her mom&#x2014;angry and heartbroken&#x2014;cut ties with the Mormon Church, which, in this town, is a huge defection. More than 90 percent of the people who live here are LDS. Being anything else automatically leaves you on the outskirts of the social world. Add into the mix that on Mrs. Green&#x2019;s salary alone, she and Autumn barely scrape by.<br> <br>Autumn looks up at me flatly. &#x201c;I can see why you wouldn&#x2019;t want to do it, Tann. It&#x2019;s a lot of work. And you&#x2019;re lazy.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>She baited me into adding the stupid class, and now, as we drive to school together the Monday after winter break, she&#x2019;s being brittle and clipped because I told her I got in.<br> <br>I can feel her heated glare on the side of my face as I turn onto Bulldog Boulevard. &#x201c;Fujita just signed your add card?&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Auddy, you&#x2019;re insane if you&#x2019;re pissed about this. You get that, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And . . . what?&#x201d; she says, ignoring my rhetorical and turning to face forward. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to do it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, why not?&#x201d; I pull into the student lot, scanning for a spot close to the door, but of course we&#x2019;re running late and there&#x2019;s nothing convenient here. I slip into a spot along the back side of the building.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tanner, do you realize what it is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How could I attend this school and not know what the Seminar is?&#x201d;<br> <br>She gives me an aggressively patient look because I&#x2019;ve just used my mocking voice and she hates it. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have to write a book. An entire book.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the end of my fuse appears, it is predictably mild: a rougher than normal shove of my door open into the frigid air. &#x201c;Auddy, what the hell? I thought you told me to add it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but you shouldn&#x2019;t do it if you don&#x2019;t want it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pull out my best smile again, the one I know she likes. I know I shouldn&#x2019;t, but hey, you use the tools you have. &#x201c;Then you shouldn&#x2019;t call me lazy.&#x201d;<br> <br>She lets out this savage growl I think I like. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so lucky and you don&#x2019;t even know it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I ignore her, grabbing my backpack from the trunk. She is confusing as hell.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you see what I mean, though, that it was so easy for you?&#x201d; She jogs after me. &#x201c;I had to apply, and interview with him, and, like, grovel. You walked into his office and he signed your add slip.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t exactly like that. I went to his office, chatted him up for a bit, updated him on my folks, and then he signed my add slip.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m met with silence, and when I turn, I realize she&#x2019;s walked in the other direction, toward a side entrance. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you at lunch, best friend!&#x201d; I call out. She raises her middle finger.<br> <br>The warmth inside the hall is heaven, but it&#x2019;s loud in here and the floors are soggy with dirty, melting snow knocked off boots. I squeak down the hall to my locker, sandwiched between Sasha Sanderson and Jack Thorne, two of the best-looking&#x2014;and nicest&#x2014;people at Provo High.<br> <br>Socially, things here are mixed. Even two and a half years later, I still feel like the new kid, and it&#x2019;s probably because most of the students here have gone to school together since kindergarten and live within a handful of wards&#x2014;meaning, they&#x2019;re in the same congregation and see each other for about a million church activities outside of school. I essentially have Auddy, Eric, and a few other friends who happen to be LDS, but cool, so they don&#x2019;t drive us too crazy and their parents don&#x2019;t worry we&#x2019;re corrupting them. Back in Palo Alto, my freshman year, I was sort of dating another guy for a few months and had a whole group of friends I&#x2019;d known since kindergarten who didn&#x2019;t blink when they saw me holding Gabe&#x2019;s hand. I wish I&#x2019;d appreciated that freedom more at the time.<br> <br>Here, girls flirt with me, sure, but most of them are Mormon and would never, not in a million years, be allowed to date me. Most LDS parents hope their children will marry in their Temple, and that just can&#x2019;t happen with someone like me, a nonmember. Unless I converted, which . . . is never going to happen. Take Sasha for example. I feel something brewing between us; she&#x2019;s super flirty and touchy, but Autumn insists it could never go anywhere. To an even greater extent, the same is true of my chances here with guys, LDS or otherwise; I don&#x2019;t get to test those waters in Provo. I&#x2019;ve had a crush on Jack Thorne since tenth grade, but he&#x2019;s off-limits for three important reasons: (1) male, (2) Mormon, (3) Provo.<br> <br>Before she got pissed at me this morning, Auddy handed me, without comment, a sheet of sparkly dinosaur stickers. So, without question, I pocketed them; Autumn is known to hand me things that will be of use at some unknown point in time, and I roll with it. As I open my locker, I realize her motive: I am notoriously bad about remembering my A and B day schedule&#x2014;we practice an alternating-day class schedule here, with periods one through four on some days and periods five through eight on others. Each term I need to tape my schedule to my locker, and each term I find myself without any tape.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re brilliant,&#x201d; Sasha says, coming up behind me to better see what I&#x2019;m doing. &#x201c;And ohmygod, you&#x2019;re so cute. Dinosaurs! Tanner, are you eight?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I got them from Autumn.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hear Sasha&#x2019;s reaction to this in her silence, the unspoken, ...</p><h2>My Midnight</h2><p>The moving account of two voyages - one distressingly real and the other disturbingly controversial. <p>Paula's factual exodus from war ravaged and non-racist Angola into apartheid South Africa. </p><p>Paula and Danny's accidental expedition - from the fascinating world of novelty into the ambiguous world of moral dilemmas.</p></p><p>Betty Pontes de Oliveira was born and raised in Angola, descendant of 1800's settlers.

But his influence extends beyond statistics, and at long last here is the first definitive biography of one of baseball&#x2019;s immortal figures. <br>&nbsp;<br>Based on meticulous research and interviews with former teammates, family, two former presidents, and Aaron himself, <i>The Last Hero </i>chronicles Aaron&#x2019;s childhood in segregated Alabama, his brief stardom in the Negro Leagues, his complicated relationship with celebrity, and his historic rivalry with Willie Mays&#x2014;all culminating in the defining event of his life: his shattering of Babe Ruth&#x2019;s all-time home-run record. <br>&nbsp;<br>Bryant also examines Aaron&#x2019;s more complex second act: his quest to become an important voice beyond the ball field when his playing days had ended, his rediscovery by a public disillusioned with today&#x2019;s tainted heroes, and his disappointment that his career home-run record was finally broken by Barry Bonds during the steroid era, baseball&#x2019;s greatest scandal. <br>&nbsp;<br>Bryant reveals how Aaron navigated the upheavals of his time&#x2014;fighting against racism while at the same time benefiting from racial progress&#x2014;and how he achieved his goal of continuing Jackie Robinson&#x2019;s mission to obtain full equality for African-Americans, both in baseball and society, while he lived uncomfortably in the public spotlight. Eloquently written, detailed and penetrating, this is a revelatory portrait of a complicated, private man who through sports became an enduring American icon.<p></p> <br> <p><strong>Questions for Howard Bryant on <em>The Last Hero</em></strong></p> <p> </p> <p><b>Q:</b> Why Henry Aaron?<br> <b>A:</b> After my second book, <em>Juicing the Game</em>, the natural progression for my thought process was heading toward one question: "Who in baseball do you admire? Is there anyone this sport can be proud of?" It wasn't simply the fatigue of writing about steroids and tainted heroes that drifted me toward Henry Aaron, but because the steroids scandal occurring during the same time as the housing-and-mortgage scandal told me something larger was taking place in this country, that the value systems we ostensibly seek--honor, integrity, accountability--were becoming almost quaint. In baseball, as the drug scandal intensified, players would tell me, "If you ain&#x2019;t cheating, you ain&#x2019;t trying." It was that level of cynicism that made me consider writing about someone who certainly was not perfect but had a larger mission for himself beyond money, that here was a person for whom those values are not quaint.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Did he cooperate?<br> <b>A:</b> It took roughly eighteen months for him to agree to speak with me. I first began working on this project in May 2006 and that was in the middle of when Barry Bonds was nearing Henry&#x2019;s record. Henry Aaron wanted nothing to do with the Bonds record chase. He didn't want to be asked questions about Bonds, did not want to be placed in the debate about anabolic steroids. He did not want to engage at all. <br><br> When Henry's attorney, Allan Tanenbaum, and I spoke for the first time, he was extremely pessimistic about the book and the public's reaction to Henry Aaron. He was convinced that the public did not care about him except in being positioned as the polar opposite of Bonds. He was certain that I was only interested in one thing: Bonds. Over many phone calls spanning several months (the key conversation taking place over Thanksgiving 2007), Allan finally accepted that my motives for writing the book had nothing to do with Bonds and everything to do with a man I considered to be an American icon. <br> <br> A few months later, on January 31 (ironically on Jackie Robinson&#x2019;s birthday), Henry Aaron and I had our first phone call. He was extremely pleasant and engaging but echoed Allan's sentiments about his own life. "People don&#x2019;t care about me," he told me. "They only care about what I did as a baseball player. There&#x2019;s more to me than that." I was amazed at the considerable divide that existed between the enthusiasm I received whenever I mentioned the possibility of writing about Henry and what he considered to be the public's perception of him.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What most surprised you during the writing/research? <br> <b>A:</b> There were many surprising aspects of the research, which is why I truly love to research and write books. Whatever your initial thoughts of your subject are, they will invariably be altered the deeper you learn. <br><br> I was as guilty as anyone in following the accepted Aaron myth: played in Milwaukee, was always overshadowed by players in bigger markets, snuck up on even the shrewdest evaluators of talent from the day he entered the big leagues to the day when suddenly he and not Willie Mays was in the best position to break Babe Ruth's all-time home run record.<br><br> None of this is true, and that was the most surprising thing. Henry Aaron was a phenom, a top prospect from the day he joined the Indianapolis Clowns. He was a comet tearing through each level in the minor leagues, and when he arrived for his first spring in Bradenton, Florida in 1954, all eyes were on him to be the next great player.<br><br> The myth came later. As the Milwaukee Braves fell in the standings at the beginning of the 1960s, people did begin to forget about Henry, and he quietly accumulated Hall of Fame numbers. But that was only because the public lost interest in a losing team, not because it was unaware of his enormous ability.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What is the lasting legacy of Henry Aaron?<br> <b>A:</b> A famous sociologist told me during an interview that the steroid scandal has created a gap between the record holders and the standard bearers of major league baseball. Barry Bonds is a record holder. Henry Aaron is a standard bearer. The latter is far more important and valuable than the former. <br><br> And it carries weight beyond the baseball diamond, where Henry always wanted respect. He spent his life being compared on the baseball diamond to Willie Mays, but Henry Aaron wanted to follow in the legacy of Jackie Robinson, to use his platform to provide opportunities for people who did not have them. Baseball was simply a means to that end.</p> (Photo � Erinn Hartman) <br><br> <p><strong>Photographs from <i>The Last Hero: A Life of Henry Aaron</i><br></strong> <b>(Click on Thumbnails to Enlarge)</b></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td></tr> <tr> <td>Clemente, Mays, and Aaron</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jacksonville, 1953</td> <td>Bradenton, 1957</td> <td>Aaron and Family</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Aaron in Atlanta</td> <td>Breaking Babe's Record</td> <td>Aaron Today</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p> <br></p><b>Howard Bryant </b>is the author of<b> </b><i>Shut Out: A Story of Race and Baseball in Boston, </i>which was a finalist for the Society for American Baseball Research&#x2019;s 2003 Seymour Medal, and<i> Juicing the Game: Drugs, Power, and the Fight for the Soul of Major League Baseball. </i>He is a senior writer for<i> </i>ESPN.com and<i> ESPN the Magazine</i>; appears regularly on ESPN&#x2019;s <i>The Sports Reporters, ESPN First Take, </i>and<i> Outside the Lines</i>; and serves as sports correspondent for NPR&#x2019;s<i> Weekend Edition Saturday. </i>He lives in western Massachusetts.<i> </i></p><h2>Djibouti: A Novel</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Elmore Leonard is in a class of one....The greatest crime writer who ever lived.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Dennis Lehane</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Elmore Leonard is our greatest crime novelist...the best in the business.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x2014;<em>Washington Post</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>44 novels and still going strong!

His stories have appeared in a variety of journals and Year's Best collections. Read his guest review of <em>Djibouti</em>:</strong> <br> <p></p> <p>In the spirit of <em>Elmore Leonard&#x2019;s 10 Rules for Writing</em>, here are ten reasons why Elmore Leonard rules&#x2013;a fact that has never been more obvious than in <em>Djibouti</em>, his 48th novel.</p> <strong>10. The babes.</strong> The heroine of Djibouti would be one Dara Barr, who has touched down in Africa to make a documentary about the booming piracy business and maybe win herself another Oscar. Dara is as laconic and unflappable as any of Leonard&#x2019;s finest heroes (see: <em>Hombre</em>, <em>Swag</em>, <em>The Hot Kid</em>), with a creative and curious streak that marks her as special. Throw in an underwear model named Helene looking to make a married man out of a billionaire who likes to play C.I.A. agent, and you&#x2019;ve got a book in which the gents are <em>waaaaaay</em> overmatched. <p></p> <strong>9. The bad boys.</strong> Creative writing teachers who want to show their students how to draft an unforgettable antagonist ought to tear out chapter 18 and pass it around. That&#x2019;s where Leonard tells us the story of James Russell, a clever Miami lowlife, who reinvents himself as Jamal Raisuli, al-Queda bomb-thrower... all in 7 pages of breezy, economical characterization. <p></p> <strong>8. The talk.</strong> Plenty has been written about Elmore Leonard&#x2019;s mastery of dialogue, and I don&#x2019;t need to rehash it. Why bother, when I could just quote some of it? An elderly terrorist, jailed in <em>The States</em>, gets talking with James Russell:<br> &#x201c;What is it you hope to become in your life?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Famous,&#x201d; James said. &#x201c;I been looking at ways.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Become a prophet? <br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t tell what will happen. I do it.&#x201d; <br> <p></p> <strong>7. The walk.</strong> Everyone hustles in an Elmore Leonard novel; you can&#x2019;t stand still and hope to score. From the slums, where life is the only thing cheaper than khat, to the clubs, where it&#x2019;s easier to find a pirate than out on the open ocean, everyone is on their way up or on their way down... in a hurry. <strong><br><br>6. The sound.</strong> Leonard famously said that if his sentences sound like writing, he rewrites them, but don&#x2019;t be fooled. These sentences jump to their own dirty, hothouse jazz rhythm. There isn&#x2019;t a better stylist anywhere in American letters. <p></p> <strong>5. The seduction.</strong> Dara isn&#x2019;t just curious about piracy; she spends thirty days on a boat with 73-year-old Xavier LeBo, long enough to fall a little in love with her best friend, and wonder if the old dude can still get it up. Xavier bets her ten-thousand dollars he can. It&#x2019;s the book&#x2019;s biggest gamble; trust me, it earns out big. <p></p> <strong>4. More boom for your buck.</strong> A lot of the suspense in Djibouti revolves around a tanker filled with enough liquefied natural gas &#x201c;to set off an explosion a hundred times bigger than the Hindenburg disaster.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s an atom bomb with a rudder and all it needs is a target. <p></p> <strong>3. The place.</strong> Leonard doesn&#x2019;t beat anyone over the head with his research, but from Djibouti to Eyl to New Orleans (the three backdrops for this story), the details are crisp, unforgettable, and right. You don&#x2019;t read Djibouti. You live there. <p></p> <strong>2. The pay-off.</strong> Everyone in an Elmore Leonard story wants one, but only the reader is guaranteed to get one, and boy do they, in a final chapter that seems inevitable, yet comes as completely unexpected. <p></p> <strong>1. The know-how.</strong> Let&#x2019;s get to it. In the fifty-plus years he&#x2019;s been turning out lean, loose, laid-back thrillers, Elmore Leonard has cast his indelible stamp on American crime fiction, inspired his peers, and spawned a thousand imitators. He&#x2019;s the kind of guy critics describe as old school, but that&#x2019;s missing it. Elmore Leonard isn&#x2019;t old school. He built the school. <p></p> (Photo of Joe Hill by Shane Leonard) <p></p> <br><blockquote><p>Elmore Leonard, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author and "the hippest, funniest national treasure in sight" (<em>Washington Post</em>), brings his trademark wit and inimitable style to this twisting, gripping&#x2014;and sometimes playful&#x2014;tale of modern-day piracy</p></blockquote><p>Dara Barr, documentary filmmaker, is at the top of her game. She's covered the rape of Bosnian women, neo-Nazi white supremacists, and post-Katrina New Orleans, and has won awards for all three. Now, looking for a bigger challenge, Dara and her right-hand-man, Xavier LeBo, a six-foot-six, seventy-two-year-old African American seafarer, head to Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, to film modern-day pirates hijacking merchant ships.</p><p>They learn soon enough that almost no one in the Middle East is who he seems to be. The most successful pirate, driving his Mercedes around Djibouti, appears to be a good guy, but his pal, a cultured Saudi diplomat, has dubious connections. Billy Wynn, a Texas billionaire, plays mysterious roles as the mood strikes him. He's promised his girlfriend, Helene, a nifty fashion model, that he'll marry her if she doesn't become seasick or bored while circling the world on his yacht. And there's Jama Raisuli, a black al Qaeda terrorist from Miami, who's vowed to blow up something big.</p><p>What Dara and Xavier have to decide, besides the best way to stay alive: Should they shoot the action as a documentary or turn it into a Hollywood feature film?</p></p><h2>Eating Fossil Fuels: Oil, Food, and the Coming Crisis in Agriculture</h2><p><p><b> A shocking outline of the interlinked crises in energy and agriculture &#x2015; and appropriate responses </b></p><p> The miracle of the Green Revolution was made possible by cheap fossil fuels to supply crops with artificial fertilizer, pesticides, and irrigation. Estimates of the net energy balance of agriculture in the US show that ten calories of hydrocarbon energy are required to produce one calorie of food. Such an imbalance cannot continue in a world of diminishing hydrocarbon resources. </p><p><i> Eating Fossil Fuels </i> examines the interlinked crises of energy and agriculture and highlights some startling findings: </p><ul><li> The world-wide expansion of agriculture has appropriated fully 40% of the photosynthetic capability of this planet. </li><li> The Green Revolution provided abundant food sources for many, resulting in a population explosion well in excess of the planet's carrying capacity. </li><li> Studies suggest that without fossil fuel based agriculture, the US could only sustain about two thirds of its present population. For the planet as a whole, the sustainable number is estimated to be about two billion. </li></ul><p> Concluding that the effect of energy depletion will be disastrous without a transition to a sustainable, relocalized agriculture, the book draws on the experiences of North Korea and Cuba to demonstrate stories of failure and success in the transition to non-hydrocarbon-based agriculture. It urges strong grassroots activism for sustainable, localized agriculture and a natural shrinking of the world's population. </p><p><b> Dale Allen Pfeiffer </b> is a novelist, freelance journalist and geologist who has been writing about energy depletion for a decade.

This excellent series re-boots the character from the beginning, reenacting Spider-Man's origin in the present day. The story is similar to, but not based on, the Spider-Man film. Brainy teenager Peter Parker gains super-powers after being bitten by a spider, loses his likable Uncle Ben to violent crime, and learns once again that "with great power comes great responsibility." The scenario by Marvel president Jemas and Brian Michael Bendis makes some intelligent revisions to the original, and the artwork is realistic, detailed, colorful, and dynamic. Bendis's excellent dialog is true to life-his teenagers sound like teenagers-and his scripting for this and other series won him the 2002 Eisner Award for best writer. An even better choice for most libraries is the hardcover Ultimate Spider-Man edition, which collects the entire contents of this and the second paperback collection, Double Trouble, into one sharp-looking oversized book. With wide crossover appeal to teens and older fans, Ultimate Spider-Man, whether in separate paperback volumes or in hardcover, is an essential purchase for all public libraries.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Red Wagon</h2><p>A simple story about complex imaginations, now in board book!

Jarrell's style, graceful and dignified, stays close to the original."-Starred/Booklist<br></p><p>"Mirror, mirror on the wall, Who is the fairest of us all?" repeatedly asks the Queen, Snow White's stepmother. She always gets the answer she wants, until Snow White turns seven, and the mirror must truthfully answer, "Snow White." At the news, the Queen turns yellow and green with envy and commands the huntsman to kill Snow White and bring her "lung and liver as a token." Thus begins another enchanting fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm!<p> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> called this collaboration between Randall and Nancy Eckholm Burkert "a sort of legend even before its time of publication." Jarrell also wrote <i>The Bat-Poet</i> and <i>The Animal Family</i>, a Newbery Honor Book. Jarrell retained the Grimm (and grim) ending to the tale, as the stepmother is forced to dance to her death. Burkert's illustrations are magical, light-filled creations that more than earn the book its Caldecott Honor Book status. This delightful book's extra-large format showcases the fabulously detailed illustrations, alternating two facing pages of art with two pages of straight text.

This textbook, consisting of seven chapters and an appendix, examines systematically how God redeems fallen humanity. The redemption of Christ is a central truth of our Catholic faith: God assumed our human nature and dwelt among us as a true man; he suffered, died, rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven to save us from sin and to raise us to the status of adopted children of God. The text begins with God&#39;s gratuitous good creation, the exalted dignity and vocation of the human person, the fall of our first parents, the wound introduced into human nature that we call Original Sin, and the promise of a savior. Next, it examines salvation history in the Old Testament as God formed his chosen people in preparation for the coming of the Messiah. Then, the text looks at Jesus Christ, God-made-man, born of the Virgin Mary, in his conception, infancy, youth, and hidden life. Next, it examines Our Lord&#39;s public ministry of preaching and working miracles. The climax of the redemption is recounted in Christ&#39;s Passion, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension. After this, the text looks at how the Church continues the redemptive mission of Christ in the world, especially through the Sacraments as the means that Christ established to convey the fruits of his redemption to all people. The text turns then to the call to Christian discipleship through holiness of life aided by God&#39;s grace and the call to Christian service. The Mystery of Redemption and Christian Discipleship finally considers the role of prayer in the life of every disciple of Christ. The text concludes with an appendix that examines various objections and challenges to the faith with an emphasis on the Christian response to the existence of evil and the value of suffering. The text is written for high school students and is designed to be completed in one semester.</p><p></p><h2>Adventure Bible for Early Readers, NIrV</h2><p>Ready for Adventure?

But only some retain the habits of exploring, learning, and discovering as they grow older. Those who do so tend to be smarter, more creative, and more successful. But at the very moment when the rewards of curiosity have never been higher, it is misunderstood and undervalued, and increasingly monopolized by the cognitive elite. A "curiosity divide" is opening up. <br><br>In <i>Curious</i>, Ian Leslie makes a passionate case for the cultivation of our "desire to know." Drawing on fascinating research from psychology, economics, education, and business, Leslie looks at what feeds curiosity and what starves it, and finds surprising answers. Curiosity is a mental muscle that atrophies without regular exercise and a habit that parents, schools, and workplaces need to nurture.<br><br>Filled with inspiring stories, case studies, and practical advice, <i>Curious </i>will change the way you think about your own mental life, and that of those around you. <br><br></p><p><b>Ian Leslie</b> writes on psychology, social trends, and politics for publications in the UK and US, including <i>Slate</i>, <i>The Economist</i>, NPR, Bloomberg.com, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Times</i>, <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and <i>Granta</i>.

These fast-paced and funny novels are now available in deluxe hardcover editions illustrated by Hayley Lazo. </p><p>In his second skirmish against the Evil Librarians who rule the world, Alcatraz and his ragtag crew of freedom fighters track Grandpa Smedry to the ancient and mysterious Library of Alexandria. Hushlanders&#x2015;people who live in the Librarian-controlled lands of Canada, Europe, and the Americas&#x2015;believe the Library was destroyed long ago. Free Kingdomers know the truth: the Library of Alexandria is still around, and it&#x2019;s one of the most dangerous places on the planet. For it is the home of the scariest Librarians of them all: a secret sect of soul-stealing Scriveners. Can Alcatraz and his friends rescue Grandpa Smedry and make it out of there alive?</p><p>"In this original, hysterical homage to fantasy literature, Sanderson's first novel for youth recalls the best in <i>Artemis Fowl</i> and <i>A Series of Unfortunate Events</i>." &#x2015;<i>VOYA </i></p></p><p>BRANDON SANDERSON is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Rithmatist</i> and <i>Steelheart</i>, both of which were selected for the American Library Association's Teens' Top Ten list. He's also written many popular and award-winning books for adults. His middle grade series, Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians, is now available in deluxe editions.Grade 5&#x2013;9&#x2014;Alcatraz Smedry is back, and the action is just as nonstop, the librarians are just as evil, and the quips and asides (and outright lies) that the author insists on inflicting upon readers are just as omnipresent. Fortunately for the fans of <i>Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians</i> (Scholastic, 2007), these are all good things. On the run from a Scrivener's Bone, a half-human, half-machine assassin that has been sent to retrieve the Translator's Lenses that Alcatraz stole in the first book, the boy receives word that his father is in mortal danger in the Library of Alexandria. He and a crew of quirky relatives with odd but very useful Talents mount a daring and completely ludicrous rescue. Though some readers may find the author's non sequiturs and frequent interruptions in the narrative off-putting, those who enjoy their fantasy with a healthy dose of slapstick humor will be delighted. Give this novel to fans of Eoin Colfer's "Artemis Fowl" (Hyperion/Miramax) and Catherine Jinks's Cadel Piggott in <i>Evil Genius</i> (Harcourt, 2007). They will appreciate Sanderson's cheerful sarcastic wit and none-too-subtle digs at librarians.&#x2014;<i>Jane Henriksen Baird, Anchorage Public Library, AK</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Charles, and was recently found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Book of Jubilees is also called the Little Genesis, Book of Divisions, and the Apocalypse of Moses. It repeats the events of Genesis and Exodus from Creation to the Exodus of the Children of Israel from Egypt. It recounts the events in sets of jubilees (sets of 49 years) and gives additional details such as the fall of the angels, and the creation and destruction of the Nephilim. It also mentions the three classes of pre-flood Nephilim. It details the fact that one-tenth of their disembodied spirits would remain on earth as demons to tempt people and nine-tenths would be chained until the Tribulation Period.

This book will expose the truths that have been hidden by the powers that be in America. Since the European and Arab slave traders stepped foot into Africa, blacks have been told lies about their heritage. This was all by Satan&#39;s design for he is the father of lies. There is an old stereotypical expression that says &#34;If you want to hide something from a Black person, put it in a book.&#34; Well, this is THE BOOK that ALL Black people must read! Since biblical times, there has been a satanic agenda to destroy God&#39;s Chosen People. This agenda still exists today and is carried on by man in many forms. Satan knows who God&#39;s Chosen People are, but for centuries we have been blind to this knowledge even though it&#39;s been right in front of our face. After many years of research, the time has finally come for ALL Black people to know the truth. Inside Hebrews To Negroes you will find the answers to all the burning questions you have wanted ask your parents, teachers and pastors for years. It has been said that the mind has a strong drive to correct itself over a period of time if it can touch some substantial ORIGINAL historical base about itself. This time period is ending and the truth is being exposed! Is this signs of the End Times? The bible says in the last days that knowledge will increase. It also says &#34;In the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:&#34; Knowledge is the TRUTH and Satan&#39;s time is running out. Don&#39;t be left behind. Find out what&#39;s really going on behind the scenes as it relates to BLACK AMERICA then and now. Afterwards you be the judge as to who God&#39;s Chosen People really are and who Satan&#39;s army is really after.

Both facets are then practiced together until another one is introduced. This feature is combined with continual review in every lesson throughout the year. Topics are never dropped but are increased in complexity and practiced every day, providing the time required for concepts to become totally familiar. Saxon Math 2 is made up of five instructional components: The Meeting, Number Fact Practice, The Lesson, Guided Class Practice and Homework, and Assessments.

He had just graduated from Middlebury College and was ready to begin his adult life, but he didn't know how. So he decided he'd walk. And listen. It would be a cross-country quest for guidance, and everyone he met would be his guide. </p><p>Walking toward the Pacific, he faced an Appalachian winter and a Mojave summer. He met beasts inside: fear, loneliness, doubt. But he also encountered incredible kindness from strangers. Thousands shared their stories with him, sometimes confiding their prejudices, too. Often he didn't know how to respond. How to find unity in diversity? How to stay connected, even as fear works to tear us apart? He listened for answers to these questions, and to the existential questions every human must face, and began to find that the answer might be in listening itself. </p><p>Ultimately, it's the stories of others living all along the roads of America that carry this journey and sing out in a hopeful, heartfelt book about how a life is made, and how our nation defines itself at the most human level.</p></p><p><b>Andrew Forsthoefel</b> is a writer, radio producer, and public speaker.

The great jazz saxophone player? If you have or if you haven&#39;t, it&#39;s okay. Look at this board book and you&#39;ll hear Charlie Parker; you&#39;ll hear music in your mind. &#34;Be bop. Fisk, fisk. Lollipop. Boomba, boomba.&#34; Look. That&#39;s Charlie swinging and spinning all over the pages. And that&#39;s Charlie&#39;s cat, waiting, waiting for him to come home...</p><p>It would seem a riddle worthy of the sphinx: how do you give children a sense of jazz music without playing a note? Chris Raschka answers loudly and clearly with the illustrated, syncopated <i>Charlie Parker Played Be Bop</i>. This sparse, rhythmic, repetitive text (inspired by a recording of Parker's "A Night in Tunisia") embraces and reflects the sound and feel of jazz when read aloud: "Charlie Parker played be bop. / Charlie Parker played saxophone. / The music sounded like be bop. / Never leave your cat alone." Whether in complete phrases or in nonsense refrains that taste like music in your mouth ("Alphabet alphabet, alphabet, alph, / Chickadee, chickadee, chickadee, chick, / Overshoes, overshoes, overshoes, o, / Reeti-footi, reeti-footi, reeti-footi, ree."), Raschka brings melody to the page, and rhythm to eager ears.<p> Raschka, whose <i>Yo! Yes?</i> won a Caldecott Honor, and whose <i>Mysterious Thelonious</i>--another ebullient, musical exploration of a jazz legend--was named a 1997 ALA Notable Book, proves once again that he is just as at home with a paintbrush as he is with a pen. His bold, quirky illustrations add movement and light to the words, buoying their already lyrical effect. <i>Charlie Parker Played Be Bop</i> is a colorful, whimsical romp through the world of jazz, sure to set young and old toes a-tapping. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Brangien Davis</i></p>Chris Raschka is the Caldecott Award-winning illustrator of <i>A Ball for Daisy</i> and <i>The Hello, Goodbye Window</i>. He is also the illustrator of <i>Yo! Yes?</i> (which won a Caldecott Honor), <i>Sourpuss and Sweetie Pie</i>, <i>Charlie Parker Played Be Bop</i>, and <i>Farmy Farm</i>.

Volume 1</h2><p>Explore the Jewish and Christian Scriptures with the world renowned Bible scholar and expert on Jewish evangelism, Rabbi Tovia Singer. This new two-volume work, Let&#x2019;s Get Biblical! Why Doesn&#x2019;t Judaism Accept the Christian Messiah?, takes the reader on an eye-opening journey through timeless passages in Tanach, and answers a pressing question: Why doesn&#x2019;t Judaism accept the Christian messiah? Are the teachings conveyed in the New Testament compatible with ageless prophecies in the Jewish Scriptures? Rabbi Singer&#x2019;s fascinating new work clearly illustrates why the core doctrines of the Church are utterly incompatible with the cornerstone principles expressed by the Prophets of Israel, and are opposed by the most cherished tenets conveyed in the Jewish Scriptures. Moreover, this book demonstrates how the Church systematically and deliberately altered the Jewish Scriptures in order to persuade potential converts that Jesus is the promised Jewish messiah. To accomplish this feat, Christian &#x201c;translators&#x201d; manipulated, misquoted, mistranslated, and even fabricated verses in the Hebrew Scriptures so that these texts appear to be speaking about Jesus. This exhaustive book probes and illuminates this thought-provoking subject. Tragically, over the past two millennia, the church&#x2019;s faithful have been completely oblivious to this Bible-tampering because virtually no Christian can read or understand the Hebrew Scriptures in its original language. Since time immemorial, earnest parishioners blindly and utterly depended upon manmade Christian &#x201c;translations&#x201d; of the &#x201c;Old Testament&#x201d; in order to understand the &#x201c;Word of God.&#x201d; Understandably, churchgoers are deeply puzzled by the Jewish rejection of their religion&#x2019;s claims. They wonder aloud why Jewish people, who are reared since childhood in the Holy Tongue, and are the bearers and protectors of the sacred Oracles of God, do not accept Jesus as their messiah. How can such an extraordinary people dismiss such an extraordinary claim? Are they just plain stubborn? Let&#x2019;s Get Biblical thoroughly answers these nagging, age-old questions.</p><p></p><h2>Fatherland: A Novel</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling classic of alternate history, a murder mystery set in a world where the Nazis won World War II&#x2014;for fans of&nbsp;<i>The Plot Against America&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Man in the High Castle</i></b><br><br> Berlin, 1964.

But you'd never know it by looking at her. To keep the family safe, Min's mother insists that none of them use any fox-magic, such as Charm or shape-shifting. They must appear human at all times. Min feels hemmed in by the household rules and resents the endless chores, the cousins who crowd her, and the aunties who judge her. She would like nothing more than to escape Jinju, her neglected, dust-ridden, and impoverished planet. She's counting the days until she can follow her older brother, Jun, into the Space Forces and see more of the Thousand Worlds. When word arrives that Jun is suspected of leaving his post to go in search of the Dragon Pearl, Min knows that something is wrong. Jun would never desert his battle cruiser, even for a mystical object rumored to have tremendous power. She decides to run away to find him and clear his name. Min's quest will have her meeting gamblers, pirates, and vengeful ghosts. It will involve deception, lies, and sabotage. She will be forced to use more fox-magic than ever before, and to rely on all of her cleverness and bravery. The outcome may not be what she had hoped, but it has the potential to exceed her wildest dreams.

He has contributed to many books including <i>The Flooring Handbook</i>. </p><p> Excerpted: <i>Introduction</i> and <i>How To Use this Book</i> </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> Most woodworkers have a "palette" of woods that they favor, experimenting with alternatives for a specific purpose, or perhaps because they come across or are given a new board or veneer, cabinetmakers choose stable boards for panels, ideally quartersawn, that will not bend and buckle, or they glue decorative veneer to man-made sheets. chairmakers select strong, long-grained woods for the legs and rails, but more decorative, softer lumber for the seat. Though carvers like ornate wood, and can carve almost anything with modern rotary tools, they prefer it to be even-grained to reduce the risk of tearing. Woodturners, though, will use almost anything, particularly if the grain and color are distinctive and will enhance the perfectly formed curves of their bowls and boxes. </p><p> Whether forced by the requirements of a particular project or just because of boredom with what is in the workshop, every woodworker comes to a point when it's time to try a new type of lumber. Today, thankfully, there is plenty to choose from. Veneers and turning blanks are easy to source and purchase by mail order, from a catalogue or over the Internet, and even boards can be ordered this way. </p><p> Each mood has its own distinctive characteristics, though of course many share similar colors, grain patterns or textures. Hardwoods are favored for their strength, decorative effects, wide range of colors and durability. Softwoods tend to be cheaper, and are often seen as functional materials for building and construction. </p><p><b> THE IDEAL LUMBER </b></p><p> Somewhere out there is the perfect lumber that is easy and pleasurable to work while also being visually interesting, the ideal lumber will also</p><ol> <li>have generally straight grain;</li> <li>be close-grained and hard for a good finish, or coarse-grained and easy to bring to a high luster;</li> <li>possess a few defects to add character without raising wastage rates to too high a level;</li> <li>have a distinctive color and figure (pattern).</li> </ol><p></p><p><b> THE FAMILY OF WOODS </b></p><p> Look through the list of woods in this book and you mill notice that some botanical and common names keep cropping up. There is an oak on almost every continent; indeed, that wood has been a giant of the lumber world for centuries. Other species that have dominated furniture making include the temperate hardwoods elm, ash and beech, and from the tropics, mahogany, teak and rosewood. </p><p> It is possible to argue that nearly all other woods are merely alternatives to these favored few, with lesser-known species gaining in popularity because of shortages or changing tastes. Woods of the genus Acer -- maple and sycamore -- are preferred for their close grain, ease of use and pale color, while cherry offers some of the qualities of mahogany but comes from a more trustworthy source. The huge number of tropical hardwoods now available perhaps reflects the attempt to find weather-resistant species to replace endangered woods such as teak, or furniture-quality species to replicate mahogany. Often they are poor imitations -- in terms of color, figure and ease of use -- of the originals, and that perhaps explains why temperate hardwoods like cherry have become so popular. Of course, tropical hardwoods are still favored in many cases for windows, doors and other joinery. </p><p> The most exotic species, such as rosewood and ebony, are now very expensive, and tend to be used only for decorative effects or as veneer. A by-product of the environmental movement has been the introduction of small quantities of previously unheard-of woods, many of them harvested by communal forestry enterprises in the tropics. Some of these are exquisite in color and figure, but as yet hardly used. </p><p><b> HOW TO CHOOSE WOOD </b></p><p> There are many factors to consider when choosing wood, If there is a strict budget to watch then price is a significant issue, and the degree of wastage may also be important. The structure of the piece way limit the range of options, depending on whether the design needs hardness, strength or a bit of give. A solid tabletop is best made from woods that are not likely to move, as are drawer components, which need to fit well for years. </p><p> Color may be important, either to match existing furniture, or to enhance the specific design. Stains and dyes can help, though many woodworkers prefer the integrity of an unadulterated finish. You may need to consider grain pattern and figure. Though it is often tempting to use the most decorative woods you can find, sometimes intricate designs demand less sophisticated surface effects. In contrast, a simple design can be raised to new heights by a unique piece of lumber. </p><p> Texture can be used as creatively as color and figure. Coarse-grained species like oak and elm can be sandblasted or wire-brushed, and then limed or stained for dramatic effects, while highly polished rosewood is spectacular for more formal work. Species with contrasting colors, textures and patterns can be juxtaposes successfully, but usually needs some form of visual buffer between them, and great care needs to be taxes when attempting to form unlikely partnerships. </p><p><b> SEVEN STEPS TO CHOOSING WOOD FOR A PROJECT </b></p><ol> <li>Establish how much lumber you need, based on the design.</li> <li>Consider the eventual setting for the item in terms of style, color and texture. A plain, Shaker-style interior is likely to demand less conspicuous species such as maples, cherries, fruitwoods and birches. Most exotic hardwoods, especially from tropical forests, will suit a more formal, ornamental setting, while coarse-grained oak, elm and ash have a softer visual effect that works well in a less formal space.</li> <li>When necessary, choose woods by function: ash for bending, ebony for edge features or bandings, aromatic cedar for drawer bottoms (it will retain a fresh smell and deter bugs). You can fight a wood's natural inclinations, like trying to bend balsa, but invariably the results will on unsuccessful and the effort frustrating. Some woods do not take to glue so well, while others need special finishing treatments.</li> <li>Some species are available only in limited dimensions. You will not find many long, straight pieces of boxwood, though if is excellent for tool handles, nor wide boards of ebony, which turners adore. If a wood is not available in thicknesses greater than 1 inch it will not be easy to use for a tabletop. Of course, modern adhesives enable us to build up sections of almost any wood, as long as the grain is not so distinctive that the joins are obvious.</li> <li>Talk to fellow woodworkers and consult this book to find suitable species. Check if lumber is available from a certified sustainable source.</li> <li>Though woodworkers should always take the necessary safety precautions, find out the potential risks of using a particular wood. The dust of many woods can aggravate breathing and cause skin allergies or problems.</li> <li>Having narrowed down your options, start hunting high and low for what you want, beginning with your local supplier. It all else fails, check the alternatives listed for most species in the Wood Directory that forms the main part of this book.</li> </ol><p><b> WORKING SAFELY </b></p><p> When working with wood, always take precautions against accidents with machinery. Use ear protection and eye shields, and a mask or respirator to keep dust from your nose and lungs. Some species are hated for the noxious power of their dust, which causes respiratory and skin problems or exacerbates existing allergies. </p><p> Make sure to investigate the health hazards before using a particular wood. Specific species have not been noted as harmful because reports are anecdotal, and evidence linked to particular woods hasn't been found. It would be irresponsible so list harmful woods as some harmful species may inadvertently be missed. Woodworkers should be cautious and make a note of any effects they may suffer from wood they are using.

Herein Tozer tackles the questions of &#34;Who is the Holy Spirit&#34; and &#34;What is the Holy Spirit&#34;. Tozer then goes on to provide a detailed and meticulous account of precisely how one goes about being filled by the holy spirit.</p><p><b></b><p><b>"Are you sure you want to be possessed by a spirit other than your own? </b>Even though that spirit be the pure Spirit of God? Even though He be the very gentle essence of the gentle Jesus? Even though He be wisdom personified, wisdom Himself? Even though He be as loving as the heart of God?" &#x2014;A. W. Tozer</p><p>In a little book that's hard to swallow,&nbsp;A. W. Tozer teaches plainly who the Spirit is, why we should desire Him, but why few of us do. He instructs us in how to be filled with the Spirit, but first poses this question: Do you really want to be filled?</p>A.W. TOZER (1897_1963) began his lifelong pursuit of God after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio, at the age of&nbsp;seventeen. The self-taught theologian committed his life to the ministry of God&#x2019;s Word as a pastor, teacher, and writer. For his&nbsp;flowing prose, Spirit-filled words, and deep conviction, many have called him a modern-day prophet. Besides the beloved classic&nbsp;<i>The Pursuit of God</i>, he authored dozens of other works.</p><h2>Night Watch: A Novel of Discworld (Discworld, 29)</h2><p><p>Sir Sam Vimes gets knocked back in time thirty years in this rollicking adventure in Terry Pratchett's bestselling Discworld� series</p><p>One moment Sir Sam Vimes is in his old-patrolman form, chasing a sweet-talking psychopath across the rooftops of Ankh-Morpork. The next, he's lying naked in the street, having been sent back thirty years, courtesy of a group of time-manipulating monks who won't leave well-enough alone. This Discworld is a dark place that Vimes remembers all too well&#x2014;three decades before his title, fortune, beloved wife, and child on the way. Worse still, the murderer he's pursuing has been transported back with him. And on top of that&#x2014;it's the eve of a fabled street rebellion that killed a few good (and not so good) men. Sam Vimes knows his duty, and by changing history he might just save some worthwhile necks&#x2014;though it could cost him his own personal future. Plus there's a chance to steer a novice watchman straight and teach him a valuable thing or three about policing&#x2014;an impressionable young copper named Sam Vimes.</p></p><p>The 27th novel in the phenomenally successful <i>Discworld</i> series. <br> <br>Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch had it all. Then the lightning struck and now he's back in his own rough, tough past without even the clothes he was standing up in. Living in the past is hard. Dying in the past, however, is incredibly easy. <br> <br>But he must survive, because he has a job to do: he must track down a murderer, and teach his younger self how to be a good cop. He must also change the outcome of a bloody rebellion. There's a problem: if he wins, he's got no wife, no child, no future. <br> <br>This is a <i>Discworld</i> "Tale of One City", with a full chorus of street urchins, ladies of negotiable affection, rebels, secret policemen and other children of the revolution. Truth! Justice! Freedom! And a hard-boiled egg!<p><strong>Sir Terry Pratchett</strong> was the internationally bestselling author of more than thirty books, including his phenomenally successful Discworld series.

But both killer and detective find themselves at odds with a female investigator who has intensely personal reasons for catching the killer herself-and fast.</p><p><b>John Sandford </b>is the pseudonym of Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist John Camp. He is the author of the Prey novels, the Kidd novels, the Virgil Flowers novels, <i>The Night Crew</i>, and <i>Dead Watch. </i>He lives in New Mexico.Sandford's sixth entry in his bestselling series (Winter Prey, 1993, etc.) is another fast-paced and convincing thriller starring detective Lucas Davenport. State Investigator Meagan Connell believes that Minneapolis has a serial killer on its hands, a killer who has stepped up the frequency of his attacks. Connell is dying of cancer and is determined to catch the killer in the few weeks she has left, but Minneapolis police are skeptical. A new police chief with her eye on the Senate passes both the case and Connell on to Deputy Chief Lucas Davenport. Recently returned to the force after a two-year hiatus, Davenport agrees to work with the abrasive state investigator. A body is found in a dumpster, and then another in a park, and then there are some seemingly unrelated attacks. Cat burglar Robert Koop, a bodybuilder and former prison guard, has indeed stepped up his gruesome and deadly attacks on women. He has become obsessed with burglary victim Sara Jensen. She is unaware that Koop is watching her from the roof of the building across the street and spending time in her bed when she's not at home until she spends the night with a man. Koop, who had been leaving her initials on his victims, becomes both sloppy and even more deadly. Solid police work and good luck lead Davenport to Koop, but he needs Jensen to act as a decoy. Will Davenport be able to catch the monster before he kills again? And can they catch him before Connell's cancer kills her? A hair-raising and shocking ending provides the answers, and Davenport will be able to concentrate again on his beautiful live-in love, but there's that TV reporter who keeps inviting him for coffee... Strong on atmosphere and suspense, with a vivid cast of major and minor characters, this is a potent and compelling addition to the series.

Yet as long-held secrets and private sorrows begin to reveal themselves, they are forced to wonder: how well did they actually know the woman they called Mom?<br>&nbsp;<br>Told through the piercing voices and urgent perspectives of a daughter, son, husband, and mother, <i>Please Look After Mom</i> is at once an authentic picture of contemporary life in Korea and a universal story of family love.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2011</strong>: There is a simple, yet remarkable, scene in Kyung-sook Shin&#x2019;s novel, <em>Please Look After Mom</em>, where the book&#x2019;s title character visits her adult son in Seoul.&nbsp; He lives in a duty office in the building where he works, because he can't afford an apartment. At night, they sleep on the floor and she offers to lie next to the wall to shield him from a draft.&nbsp; &#x201c;I can fall asleep better if I&#x2019;m next to the wall,&#x201d; she says.&nbsp; And with this gesture, we catch a glimpse of the depth of love she has for her first-born and the duty-bound sacrifices she&#x2019;s made on behalf her family. <em>Please Look After Mom</em> is the story of a mother, and her family&#x2019;s search for her after she goes missing in a crowded train station, told through four richly imagined voices:&nbsp; her daughter&#x2019;s, her oldest son&#x2019;s, her husband&#x2019;s, and finally her own.&nbsp; Each chapter adds a layer to the story&#x2019;s depth and complexity, until we are left with an indelible portrait of a woman whose entire identity, despite her secret desires, is tied up in her children and the heartbreaking loss that is felt when family bonds loosen over time. Kyung-sook Shin&#x2019;s elegantly spare prose is a joy to read, but it is the quiet interstitial space between her words, where our own remembrances and regrets are allowed to seep in, that convicts each one of us to our core.<em>--Shane Hansanuwat</em> <strong><br><br>Guest Reviewer: Jamie Ford</strong> <br> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <em><strong>Jamie Ford</strong> is the </em>New York Times<em> bestselling author of </em>Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet.<p></p> <p>Some books change us. They change the way we look at ourselves, the way we interact with those closest to our hearts--the way we&#x2019;ve loved those people, or the way we&#x2019;ve missed them or honored them or taken them hopelessly for granted.

Permanently.</p> <p>When Park So-nyo, an elderly mother from a rural town visiting her children on her birthday, vanishes over the event horizon of a crowded Seoul train station, four narratives unfold--four dimensions of loss, anger, blame, and sacrifice--four angles of persistence.

Why did you decide to structure the novel in this way? Which voice came to you first? </b><br> Human beings are multi-dimensional. But what we know about our mothers doesn&#x2019;t always tell the whole story of who they are. I wanted to show a &#x2018;Mom&#x2019; who was a complex and profound human being. As it was impossible to do this in a single person&#x2019;s voice, I needed multiple narrators. In the novel, the voices of the daughter, son and father are narrated in the second person, &#x201c;you&#x201d; and the third person, &#x201c;her&#x201d;. It&#x2019;s only the mother who uses the first person. I had in mind the fact that, when a woman becomes a mother, she no longer gets to speak or sometimes even think in terms of that &#x201c;I&#x201d;. Of the four different voices in the book, the mother&#x2019;s is perhaps the most vivid and powerful. When I was writing it, it felt as though my mother&#x2019;s hand had held&#x2014;even gripped&#x2014;my authorial hand, so that she could tell her own story. <b>This is an extremely personal novel, and readers will undoubtedly think about their relationship with their own mothers while reading. Did you draw on your relationship with your own family while writing the book? </b><br> My own family relationships do in fact make up the background, but the episodes in the novel were invented, or altered from reality. My own mother for example, thankfully, has never gone missing. But, speaking at a symbolic level, many mothers of our generation, I believe, have gone missing or remain neglected. <p></p> <b>Has your mother read this novel? If so, what did she think/say to you about it?</b><br> That she was proud of me for having written it. <p></p> <b>In <i>Please Look After Mom</i>, you beautifully describe many elements of Korean culture&#x2014;the Full Moon Harvest, the food, clothing, etc.&#x2014;that most Americans may not be familiar with. Are there any traditions that you are particularly excited to share with readers here?</b> <br> The novel&#x2019;s various aspects of Korean culture came up naturally as I was describing the everyday life of the &#x2018;Mom&#x2019; character. The Chuseok holiday, or the Full Moon Harvest, in Korea is similar to Thanksgiving in America. On that day, family members all over the country return to their hometowns. In order to show gratitude to our ancestors, offerings are prepared from the season&#x2019;s harvest. We also pay our respects at their gravesites. On a clear night, you can see the full moon on Chuseok. There&#x2019;s a popular saying that translates roughly to, &#x201c;May your life be as plentiful and full of joy as a Chuseok night.&#x201d; It expresses the sentiment that the person&#x2019;s life will be as bright as the full moon during the harvest festival. Last year, I got to spend my first American Thanksgiving in New York. I was invited to have dinner by a friend who&#x2019;d been living in New York for a long time. Turkey was served, of course, and I had a wonderful time sharing the meal with my host&#x2019;s family. Just as Americans celebrate the day over turkey, Koreans spend Chuseok sharing songpyeon, or half-moon shaped rice cakes, with their families. I was delighted by the similarities between the two holidays. Dining with someone, especially these days, isn&#x2019;t simply a matter of sating one&#x2019;s hunger&#x2014;preparing a meal with someone and dining under the same roof is of course a way of connecting. You can drink tea with just anyone, but to dine with someone shows how close you are to that person. In my book, &#x2018;Mom&#x2019; is always preparing warm meals, often to send them to family members living out in the city. I wanted food to play an important role in my book&#x2014;a symbol of warmth that can&#x2019;t be expressed with words. I wish I could prepare for my American readers the many Korean dishes that appear in <i>Please Look After Mom</i>, so that we could share them together! <p></p> But, moving beyond food, Korea has a number of beautifully elegant Buddhist temples, such as Hwaeomsa, Pusoksa and Haeinsa, and <i>seowon</i> (a kind of Confucian academy) such as Dosanseowon and Byungsanseowon. These are sacred and quiet spaces, containing the spirit and culture of the country. You should definitely pay them a visit if you are ever in Korea. If you have an interest in music, try listening to <i>pansori</i>, Korean traditional music, which contains a different resonance than Western harmonics, and expresses a distinctly Korean sorrow and humor. <p></p> <b>Your novel is being published in many countries and people around the world are identifying with the characters you have depicted. What are some of the universal truths of the relationship between mothers and children that you explore in the novel?</b> <br> The line by Mom when she finds her mother&#x2019;s soul (&#x201c;Did Mom know? That I, too, needed her my entire life?&#x201d;) expresses, I believe, a universal truth. When I&#x2019;d written that sentence, I felt that the work was complete. We all need mothers, regardless of who we are. Even those who are currently mothers! <p></p> <b>One theme that runs throughout the novel is that of personal dreams versus sacrifice for family. Do you feel that this struggle is different for older and younger generations?</b> <br> There&#x2019;s that old saying that God couldn&#x2019;t do everything himself, so he created mothers. No matter how much society advances, there&#x2019;s bound to be some gap between a woman&#x2019;s desire for self-actualization and her need to give of herself for her family. Of course, the situation has improved a great deal, but the dilemma persists. It still holds that one person&#x2019;s development comes from someone else&#x2019;s care and sacrifice: nothing and no one can replace a mother. I think humankind has been able to sustain itself because, at its center, there&#x2019;s this entity called, &#x201c;Mom.&#x201d; <p></p> <b>You are now an extremely well-known and widely respected author in Korea. Has this fame dramatically changed your life, and your experience of being a writer? What kind of responses did the novel receive in Korea?</b><br> I published my first work of fiction in a Korean literary journal at twenty-two. From age sixteen to thirty, I was always working. I went to high school at night and worked during the day for a company that made stereo systems. When I was in college, I would tutor children, write and do research for the school newspaper, and read to those who&#x2019;d suddenly gone blind. Even after my first book was published, I worked all sorts of jobs, any really, that would allow me to write: an editor at a publishing house, a writer for a classical radio station or for magazines, etc. My experience at these jobs provided vivid material for when it came time to write. But it was when I was about to turn thirty, when I published my second book, that people began to really pay attention. It was totally unexpected. The book was a collection of nine stories, and within six-months after it was published, 300,000 copies had been sold. It was the first time that a short-story collection had done so well in Korea. Everyone was surprised. For the next twenty years, my readers have stayed with me for every book I published. Thanks to their support, I have been able to live a life of great freedom, and to devote all of my time to writing. This was a dramatic shift for me. Writing and my personal life became like two sides of the same coin. Whatever I was experiencing at a personal level in Korean society, I tried novelizing to the most truthful and powerful extent possible, and my readers seemed to actively engage with my work and sympathize with it. Even today, I write a little every day without being tied down to anything else. I only feel free when I&#x2019;m writing, and the best way I know how to give back for this invaluable freedom is to write in a way that engages people&#x2014;and will make readers curious about what the next work will be like! <p></p> <b>Although this is your first book to be published in English, you&#x2019;ve written numerous other works of fiction. When did you first begin to write and what topics were you drawn to?</b><br> I&#x2019;m the product of my mother&#x2019;s influence. My mother would look so happy when she saw me reading a book. I started out reading to bring more happiness to my mother, who always looked so tired. Even before I was ten, it was my dream to become a writer. I began writing fiction on my own when I was in high school. Of course, it was an exercise more than anything. I wrote in any form I wanted&#x2014;stories, essays, poems&#x2014;pieces where often, the beginning didn&#x2019;t even fit with the end. I was a young girl who&#x2019;d moved to Seoul from the countryside. I lied about my age to get a job at a company. Back then, South Korea was an industrial society and not yet a democracy, and there were disputes between the workers and the company, demonstrations almost every day. Hearing cries of protest from outside, I would lay out my notebook on the conveyor belt and write. Writing was what got me through those years; five years later, I formally made my debut as a writer. <p></p> I wrote, wanting to produce a work that expressed human beauty and its almost magical strength even when confronted with the most tragic situations. I wanted, too, to write about respect and compassion for life. Now that I am older I have these same hopes. But I also hope that after they read my works, readers will be seized by the longing to remember and see again someone they&#x2019;d forgotten, or some aspect of life they may have overlooked. Whenever I see people drowning in suffering and sadness, I feel a strong compulsion to return to my writing. I would like for my work to in a way play a maternal role, of standing by those who feel sorrow, whether it is of social or personal origin. <p></p> <b>Tell us more about your writing habits. When and where do you like to write?</b><br> I like best to write from 3 in the morning till 9 in the morning. I like the feeling of writing in darkness and working myself, little by little, towards light. One of my habits as I write is that I often wash my hands in cold water. <p></p> <b>Is there a message that you hope readers take away from <i>Please Look After Mom</i>? </b><br> I&#x2019;ll point you to the novel&#x2019;s epigraph, by Franz Liszt: &#x201c;Love, so long as you can love.&#x201d; And I&#x2019;d hope you&#x2019;d remember, and realize again the plain truth that your mother was not born that way, that she too had to become a mother. Taking the time to think about your mother might also mean taking the time to think about yourself. If anyone wants to call his or her mother after reading this book, it would please me very much. <p></p> <b>Lastly, you are living here in the U.S. this year, studying at Columbia. What have you enjoyed most about living in New York?</b><br> I&#x2019;m very much enjoying the tremendous variety of culture New York has to offer: MoMA, The Guggenheim, The Met, The Frick, The Morgan Library, The Whitney. I&#x2019;m also visiting small galleries in Chelsea. I&#x2019;ve been going to the opera, theater, musicals, the ballet and the cinema. I&#x2019;m also trying all sorts of cuisines. Restaurants from all of the world seem to be gathered in New York. The beauty, spectacle and drama that echoes at the Metropolitan Opera, especially, is something you can&#x2019;t get in Korea, so I have acquired season tickets. But, &#x201c;culture&#x201d; is everywhere here; the streets of Manhattan themselves feel like theater. When I&#x2019;m strolling around, I always have the pleasure of finding something new that I didn&#x2019;t notice the day before. <p></p><p><b>Kyung-Sook Shin</b> is the author of numerous works of fiction and is one of South Korea&#x2019;s most widely read and acclaimed novelists.

Some of the oldest cultures speak of civilizations inside of vast cavern-cities, within the bowels of the earth. According to certain Buddhist and Hindu traditions, secret tunnels connect Tibet with a subterranean paradise, and they call this legendary underworld Agartha. In India, this underground oasis is best known by its Sanskrit name, Shambhala, thought to mean &#39;place of tranquility.&#39; Mythologies throughout the world, from South America to the Arctic, describe numerous entrances to these fabled inner kingdoms. Many occult organizations, esoteric authors, and secret societies concur with these myths and legends of subterranean inhabitants, who are the remnants of antediluvian civilizations, which sought refuge in hollow caverns inside the earth.Assuming that the myths are true, and the Earth is partially hollow, how could life survive underground? How would organisms receive the ventilation required to breathe miles below the surface? What would provide the light needed to see, or to cause the photosynthesis necessary for the plant life that allegedly exists in these inner worlds? Are there any known sources of sustenance available that could provide for a large human population? What evidence is there that a sustainable biosphere could exist miles below the surface, totally isolated from the nourishment and the established life cycle provided by the sun? Where are the entrances to inner earth, and which races live there?Author and anthropologist, Robert Sepehr, explores these questions and attempts to unlock their riddles, which have eluded any serious consideration in mainstream academia. Numerous endevours have been undertaken to access the interior of the earth. Polar expeditions and battles, such as Operation Highjump, still remain largely classified, and have been shrouded in secrecy for decades, but scientific revelations validating the rumors surrounding these covert events, and their implications, are finally being exposed to daylight. What are the mysteries of inner Earth?</p><p>Robert Sepehr is an author, producer, and anthropologist specializing in linguistics, archeology, and paleobiology. A harsh critic of the out-of-Africa theory, Sepehr puts forth alternative diffusionist arguments often involving advanced antediluvian civilizations, occult secret societies, ancient mythology, alchemy and astrotheology.</p><h2>The Mask Omnibus Volume 1 (Second Edition)</h2><p><b>The bestselling comic trilogy that inspired the blockbuster film <i>The Mask </i>is collected in this omnibus edition of gruesome hilarity!</b><br><br>A weird mask of unknown origin and power is discovered and imbues its wearer with limitless cartoon character invulnerability that takes the nerdy Stanley Ipkiss, the police, the mafia, and the monstrous mob muscleman Walter on a colliding violent path of homicidal mayhem, lunacy, and destruction! <br><br>Collects <i>The Mask</i>, <i>The Mask Returns</i>, and <i>The Mask Strikes Back</i>!</p><p><b>John Arcudi </b>is a comic book writer and creator from Buffalo, New York.

There are many reasons for him to be killed, and many people who would do the deed. But who did?&nbsp; Lucas Davenport has an idea. But this routine murder investigation is about to turn into something different. A cat-and-mouse game with a killer who does not hesitate to take the fight to Lucas himself. And those he loves...<br><br>WITH A NEW INTRODUCTION BY THE AUTHOR</p><p>John Sandford is back with his dapper, dangerous Minneapolis deputy police chief Lucas Davenport for a ninth "preyer" meeting. Fans of the series will be glad to hear that it's full of smart suspense and deduction as well as explosive action. Davenport and his fellow cops are still recovering from the deadly revenge scheme that maimed them in <i>Sudden Prey</i>, which seems to have ended the relationship between Lucas and his doctor lady friend. This accounts for the depression that dogs him as he is sent to investigate the killing of top banking executive Daniel Kresge in a hunting lodge north of Minneapolis. Any of Kresge's four fellow hunters--all employees at his Polaris Bank--could have shot him, and all had motives, as did his almost ex-wife. About halfway through the book we find out who the real killer is, just a few pages before Lucas does, and that villain is a masterful creation, an example of the banality of evil worthy of Hannah Arendt. This is where Sandford's beautifully honed skills at creating suspense really kick in: he keeps us fascinated as Davenport, revitalized by an affair with a jaunty colleague, tries to turn what we all know into hard evidence. <i>--Dick Adler</i><b>John Sandford</b> is the pseudonym of Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist John Camp.

That&#x2019;s a pretty common subject for a novel and not very interesting in itself. But there&#x2019;s magic that happens when you pick up a book, start reading and realize that what the author has chosen to write about&#x2014;the places, the characters, the dialogue, the set pieces&#x2014;they&#x2019;re all just right. That&#x2019;s how I felt reading this book. <em>The Nest</em> is not populated with characters who are entirely lovable, but I felt each was uniquely human and identifiable, and I especially wanted to know where life would take the four 40-something Plumb family siblings (particularly that rapscallion Leo). Some will take issue with the Plumbs and their upper middle class problems. Some will detest Leo and his family and find harsher descriptions than &#x201c;rapscallion.&#x201d; But for my money, <em>The Nest</em> is a great read.

Tilford and Mary L. Wulff, is the bible for all pet owners looking to enhance their companion animals&#x2019; lives through natural therapies. Now in its second revised edition, Herbs for Pets is an indispensable resource, an exhaustive compendium of medicinal plants and natural remedies that hosts an illustrated tour through Western, ayurvedic, and Chinese herbs that grow in North America, including their holistic applications and contraindications, and alternative approaches to treating a wide range of ailments. Remedies in the book are applicable to dogs and cats, as well as birds, small mammals, and even farm animals.<br>The book is organized into three chapters, the first is dedicated to the Principles and Practices of Herbalism,&#x201d; discussing the many facets of herbs, concerns about toxicity, basic herbal preparation, the ethical use of herbs, the connection between herbs and diet, and using herbs as dietary supplements.<br> <br>Chapter 2, titled Materia Medica: An A-Z Guide to Herbs for Animals,&#x201d; is an exhaustive 150-page section presenting color photographs and text about the appearance, habitat and range, cycle and bloom season, parts used, primary medicinal activities, strongest affinities, common uses, availability, propagation and harvest, alternatives and adjuncts, and cautions and comments for 65 different herbs (from Alfalfa to Yucca!). The common uses section is extensive for each herb, discussing the nutrient value, various qualities, and ways in which the herb is used for specific treatments.<br> <br>The third chapter of the book is titled An Herbal Repertory for Animals: Ailments and Treatments&#x201d; and details remedies for the following: anxiety, nervousness, and behavioral problems; arthritis and hip dysplasia; cancer; cardiovascular problems; digestive system problems; ear problems; elderly animal care; endocrine system and related problems; epilepsy, convulsions, and seizures; eye problems; first aid, immune system care; mouth and nose problems; parasite-related problems; pregnancy and lactation; skin problems; and urinary problems.

The authors, both herbalists, begin with a chapter on the principles and practices of herbalism, explaining the basics of herbal preparations and what they call the "ethical use of herbs." They discuss the connection between herbs and diet and give guidelines for feeding dogs and cats. The bulk of the book is a 191-page guide to herbs for animals. Each entry includes a description of the plant, its habitat and range, its cycle and bloom season, preparation, common uses, availability, and propagation and harvest techniques. Also included are a warning of its side effects--if any--and a photograph of the plant.

Now, in <em>Spiritual Direction</em>, the first of a series, one of Nouwen's students (Michael Christensen) and one of his editors (Rebecca Laird) have developed his courses and practice of spiritual direction into a book of profound wisdom for living a deep spiritual life.</p></p><p>Henri Nouwen understood the spiritual life as a journey of faith and transformation, marked by distinct movements and corresponding disciplines, and deepened by accountability, community, and ministry. This book provides readers with an experience in spiritual direction with Nouwen, well-known author, priest, and guide. Readings, stories, questions for personal reflection and guided journal inquiry as articulated by Nouwen in his courses on spiritual direction/formation and in his personal and group spiritual direction sessions are gathered to provide an unparalleled resource on a thoughtful spiritual life. Following a familiar structure which reappeared in his many lectures and books, Nouwen suggests that four simple changes will reorient our lives, opening the door to true spiritual transformation.Henri J.M. Nouwen was a world-renowned spiritual guide, counselor, and bestselling author of over forty books that many today consider spiritual classics. He taught at the universities of Harvard, Yale, and Notre Dame before becoming the senior pastor of L&#x2019;Arche Daybreak in Toronto, Canada, a community where men and women with intellectual disabilities and their assistants create a home for one another.</p><h2>Clean Soups: Simple, Nourishing Recipes for Health and Vitality [A Cookbook]</h2><p><b>From bestselling author Rebecca Katz comes this collection of 60 recipes for pure, cleansing soups intended to renew and restore.<br></b><br>Soup has a unique ability to nourish and heal the body.

He is the former anchor/director of the Johns Hopkins Health Newsfeed, a nationally syndicated daily radio program. This is the fifth book he has co-authored with Rebecca Katz. He lives in Washington, DC.INTRODUCTION<br><br>Throughout my twenty-year culinary consulting and cooking<br> career in the food-as-medicine movement, I&#x2019;ve been, first and foremost,<br> a soup-maker. I&#x2019;ve practiced my craft in kitchens as diverse as the Chopra<br> Center for Wellbeing, Dr. Andrew Weil&#x2019;s Arizona Center for Integrative<br> Medicine&#x2019;s annual Nutrition and Health Conference, and the Commonweal<br> Retreat Center in Bolinas, California. It was at Commonweal&#x2019;s retreats,<br> when I was often cooking for seriously ill people, that I realized how<br> energizing a nutrient-dense, delicious soup could be. It was amazing:<br> people who could barely eat would return again and again to the soup pot.<br> I was doling out a little liquid health with each dip of the ladle.<br><br>I guess that makes me just the latest in a very long line of soup shamans.<br> Some people may think of soup-making for health purposes as a trend.<br> But the truth is, from the Baha&#x2019;i to the Buddhists, and from the Christians<br> to the simply curious, using soup to help the body detoxify and renew<br> itself is as old as humankind. Hippocrates and Greek physicians used bone<br> broths as a curative for the sick and fatigued.<br><br>Flash forward a couple of millenia, and you&#x2019;ve got companies coming<br> out of the woodwork promoting their healthy soups. Sure, if you want to<br> spend up to $300 for a week&#x2019;s worth of commercially made soups, this<br> is a possible option, but wouldn&#x2019;t you rather learn from a master how<br> to make healthy soups on your own? Delicious soups that you can pull<br> together in a half hour or less can lead you to true soup empowerment.<br><br>It&#x2019;s really that easy, as you&#x2019;ll see in this book. And it&#x2019;s really that healthy.<br> Eating soup is a way to hit the body&#x2019;s reset button, to allow internal organs<br> devoted to detoxification the rest and nutrients necessary to successfully<br> do their job. The result, from a health viewpoint, is often startling, but no<br> one should really be surprised. Soup, after all, is life distilled into a bowl.<br> Unlike juicing, nothing is lost in the stockpot; indeed, just the opposite<br> takes place. The heat of the pot slowly breaks down nutrients to a more<br> digestible state, simultaneously releasing outrageous flavors that create<br> heady aromas that magnetically draw us to the broth.<br><br>This book is dedicated to the proposition that everyone can enjoy making<br> soup, whether the goal is a full-blown, two-day, nothing-but-soup cleanse,<br> or a more general commitment to incorporate soup on a daily or weekly<br>basis. Believe me, the ability to create culinary alchemy in a pot can be<br> learned (I&#x2019;m living proof), and the payoff is so high: when you&#x2019;re feeling out<br> of sorts, and your appetite or digestion may be off, soup is the absolutely<br> best way to make a healthy reconnection with food. It&#x2019;s like taking your<br> body to a spa. You&#x2019;ll come out feeling marvelous.<br>KALE SOUP WITH COCONUT AND LIME<br><br>Talk about counterbalancing tastes: here the u&#x308;berhealthy kale and coconut&nbsp;milk are a magical pairing, with the sweetness of the coconut neutralizing&nbsp;the natural bitterness of the kale. The ginger and lime are like Fourth of July&nbsp;sparklers on top of the flavor profile. The soup is purposely a bit thin, and&nbsp;many people enjoy it as a broth in a cup or take it to go in a thermos. If you&nbsp;want to give it a little heft, try adding glass noodles or shredded sweet potato.<br><br>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive<br> oil or coconut oil<br> 2 cloves garlic, minced<br> 2 tablespoons minced&nbsp;fresh ginger<br> 2 bunches kale, stemmed and&nbsp;cut into bite-size pieces<br> Sea salt<br> 6 cups Thai Coconut Broth<br> 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly&nbsp;squeezed lime juice<br> 2 1/2 teaspoons dark maple syrup<br> 1 tablespoon finely chopped&nbsp;fresh Thai basil, for garnish<br><br>Heat the oil in a soup pot over medium-high&nbsp;heat, then add the garlic and ginger, stir, and&nbsp;cook for about 1 minute. Add the kale and&nbsp;1/2 teaspoon sea salt and saute for 3 minutes,&nbsp;or just until emerald green. Add the broth and&nbsp;cook until the kale is tender, about 3 minutes.&nbsp;Remove from the heat.<br><br>Pour 2 cups of the broth into a blender,&nbsp;add one-third of the kale mixture, and&nbsp;blend until smooth. Transfer to a soup&nbsp;pot over low heat, and repeat the process&nbsp;two more times. Stir in the lime&nbsp;juice, maple syrup and . teaspoon<br> sea salt. Serve garnished with the&nbsp;basil, or store in an airtight container&nbsp;in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in&nbsp;the freezer for up to 3 months.</p><h2>Writer&#39;s Toolbox: Learn How to Write Letters, Fairy Tales, Scary Stories, Journals, Poems, and Reports</h2><p>Turn readers into writers.

He is the author of more than thirty books, including <i>They Shall Expel Demons, </i>which has sold more than 50,000 copies since publication in 1998, and <i>Blessing or Curse, </i>which has sold more than 150,000 copies.(From the foreword) People hear what you say but learn from what you are. That is true when you read or listen to Derek Prince. He imparts his life into his work and we are all the better for it. Derek has written a book that is to be read not just by the father, but by the father to his whole family! God bless him for making God's truth available to us all -- <i>Dr. Edwin Lewis Cole, Christian Men's Network</i><br><br>It is my pleasure to highly recommend to you Derek Prince's latest book, Husbands and Fathers. I have known Derek Prince for almost thirty years and know him to be one of the finest Bible scholars on the earth today. Derek has expressed his view that delinquent males are societys #1 problem. Derek, a best-selling author with a worldwide radio ministry, who is also twice widowed and the father of twelve adopted children, sets forth the biblical foundation for men to function and excel in their most vital role. If you read one book this year, make it this one. This book is a definite guide for every man who wants to be a more godly husband and father -- <i>John C. Hagee, John Hagee Ministries and senior pastor, Cornerstone Church</i><br><br>Prince joins the chorus of voices providing powerful reasons to stand firm for the family. He says that men's own hearts must be cleansed before they can effectively lead and that dads need a right relationship with the Heavenly Father before they can model spiritual love to their children. Prince believes husbands should take more initiative so their natural leadership wont be usurped. He says marriages will prosper only if Christians are faithful to God's unchanging standards. Prince also urges parents to thank God daily forand truly enjoytheir children. As the father of 12, he knows whereof he speaks! He challenges dads to set worthy examples by living truthfully and refusing worldly compromises. Fathers have a responsibility to bring their flocks safely into eternity. This helpful resource makes the task easier. -- <i>CBA Marketplace, January 2000</i><br><br>What a day we live in. The sacred institution of marriage is rotting and eroding. Bewildered parents are streaming to secular sources for answers to an avalanche of serious family problems. And worst of all, the fathers, who should be serving as the priest of the family, are groping in darkness, searching for their identities. In Husbands and Fathers: Rediscover the Creators Purpose for Men, the reader will hear clearly the voice of experience. Derek Prince, a seasoned earthly father and a spiritual father to millions, brings light to the darkness. Reader, what you hold in your hands should be hidden in your heart -- <i>Stephen Hill, evangelist, Pensacola Revival</i></p><h2>The Adolescent Psychotherapy Progress Notes Planner (PracticePlanners)</h2><p><b>Save hours of time-consuming paperwork with the bestselling therapist's resource</b><br> <i>The&nbsp;Adolescent Psychotherapy Progress Notes Planner, Fifth Edition,</i> contains more than 1,000&nbsp;complete prewritten session and patient descriptions for each behavioral problem in <i>The&nbsp;Adolescent Psychotherapy Treatment Planner, Fifth Edition</i>.

Polarizing, us-against-them discussions divide us and distract us from thinking clearly and communicating lovingly with others. Scott Sauls, like many of us, is weary of the bickering and is seeking a way of truth and beauty through the conflicts.&nbsp;<i>Jesus Outside the Lines&nbsp;</i>presents Jesus as this way.&nbsp;Scott shows us how the words and actions of Jesus reveal a response that does not perpetuate the destructive fray. Jesus offers us a way forward - away from harshness, caricatures and stereotypes. In&nbsp;<i>Jesus Outside the Lines</i>, you will experience a fresh perspective of Jesus, who will not (and should not) fit into the sides.</p><p>Scott Sauls serves as senior pastor of Christ Presbyterian Church in Nashville, Tennessee. Previously, Scott was a lead and preaching pastor for Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, where he worked alongside Dr. Timothy Keller. Scott has also planted two churches--one in Kansas City, Kansas, and the other in St. Louis, Missouri. Scott is a frequent speaker at church conferences, leadership retreats, and to university students. Scott currently lives in Nashville with his wife, Patti, and his daughters, Abby and Ellie. Learn more about Scott on his blog at scottsauls.com, or by following @scottsauls on Twitter.Choosing sides in cultural conflicts has left us feeling stereotyped and caricatured. With theological insight, cultural astuteness, and the compassionate tone of Jesus, Scott has painted a way for the church to have influence without coercion and put the brilliance of Jesus on display in a pluralistic world. A worthy read. (Jon Tyson)<br><br>Scott seamlessly weaves together theology, cultural critique, Christian ethics, and character formation. The result is a picture of Christian living that should be attractive to believers and to many skeptics as well. (Tim Keller)<br><br>A compelling vision for how to follow the real Jesus in real life. <i>Jesus Outside the Lines</i> is a guide that helps followers of Jesus love God and the world around them.

When Johnny comes over the hill, a pioneer family welcomes him to their log cabin home, where the mother feeds him, the father accepts his help chopping wood, and the children ask for a story. He obliges with a rambling tale of his life, from his humble beginnings in a large family to his happiness at being on the road, where "all across the land, folks are enjoying apples from my trees." Wohnoutka contributes a series of buoyant paintings that capture the beauty of the landscape, the innocent goodness of the people, and the slightly larger-than-life persona of Johnny Appleseed. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Adult humans are completely absent, which leaves room for the fox waiter, the raccoon baker, the pig flautist, and all the other animals of this peaceable kingdom.

Why Simple Wins helps leaders and their teams move beyond the feelings of frustration and futility that come with so much unproductive work in today's corporate world to create a corporate culture where valuable, essential, meaningful work is the norm. By learning how to eliminate redundancies, communicate with clarity, and make simplification a habit, individuals and companies can begin to recognize which activities are time-sucks and which create lasting value.&nbsp; Lisa Bodell's simplification method has several unique principles:&nbsp; Simplification is a skill that's available to us all, yet very few leaders use it. Simplification is the right thing to do--for our customers, for our company, and for each other. Operating with simplification as our core business model will make it easier to be respectful of each other's time. Simplification drives culture, and culture in turn drives employee engagement, customer relations, and overall productivity. </p> <p>This book is inspired by Bodell's passion for eliminating barriers to innovation and productivity. In it, she explains why change and innovation are so hard to achieve--and it's not what you might expect. The reality is this: we spend our days drowning in mundane tasks like meetings, emails, and reports. These are often self-created complexities that prevent us from getting to the meaningful work that truly matters.&nbsp; Using simple stories and techniques, Why Simple Wins shows that by using simplicity as an operating principle, we can eliminate the busy work that puts a chokehold on us every day, and instead spend time on the work that we value.</p></p><p><b>Lisa Bodell</b> believes in the power of simplification. She is the founder and CEO of futurethink, a company that uses simple techniques to help organizations embrace change and increase their capability for innovation. She brings her compelling message to over 100,000 people a year, showing them how to eliminate mundane and unnecessary tasks from their everyday routine so that they have more time for work that matters. Bodell has transformed teams within organizations like Google, Novartis, Accenture, and more. Drawing on her practical Midwestern upbringing and entrepreneurial background, she has used the power of simplification to launch three successful businesses, write two books (<i>Kill the Company</i> and <i>Why Simple Wins</i>), travel to over 40 countries and 48 states, and sit on boards such as Novartis Diversity and Inclusion Board and the Global Advisory Council for the World Economic Forum."Why Simple Wins makes a compelling case against the scourge of complexity. Lisa Bodell shows that simplification can be the competitive advantage of our time, helping us to be more innovative, more adaptable, and better positioned to thrive and truly have an impact." -- Arianna Huffington, Author of <i>Thrive</i> and <i>The Sleep Revolution</i><br><i></i><br>"There are two ways to achieve simplicity: ignorance and elegance. Lisa Bodell empowers us to move toward the elegant, delivering practical tools for reducing time wasted on low-value tasks so we can free up energy for innovative thinking." -- Adam Grant, Wharton professor and New York Times bestselling author of <i>Originals</i> and <i>Give And Take</i><br><br>"Americans work among the longest hours of any advanced economy. We're time starved, busy, burned out and disengaged at work. But far from throwing up her hands in despair, Lisa Bodell uses compelling real world stories, eye-popping statistics and practical hands-on tools to show how work itself has become too complex, and how simplifying can help reclaim what's gotten lost: time for work that matters. Why simple Wins is a must-read for 21st century workplaces." &nbsp;-- Brigid Schulte, award-winning journalist and author of the New York Times bestselling <i>Overwhelmed: Work, Love &amp; Play when No One has the Time</i> and director of the Better Life Lab at New America<br><br>"Complexity is at the center of the world's most significant challenges. Lisa Bodell shines a bright light on the single most significant leadership priority of this era. We need to simplify everything!" -- Bill McDermott, Chief Executive Officer, SAP<br><br>"Through Why Simple Wins, Lisa Bodell demonstrates that simplification is more than another buzzword. It must become our new way of working." -- Frank Brown, Managing Director and COO, General Atlantic, and Former Dean of INSEAD<br><br>"Lisa Bodell unearths the root of complexity: the fears, need for control, and risk aversion of human beings. She also shows us the path toward simplicity, where removing layers of process and bureaucracy becomes an ethical imperative." -- Joel Klein, Chief Policy &amp; Strategy Officer, Oscar Insurance; former Chancellor, New York City Public Schools<br><br>"For anyone who feels buried in unanswered emails, unproductive meetings, and endless to-do lists, Bodell's book is a must-read. She explains why complexity often gets the best of our companies and lives--and she provides practical methods and tools that can yield much-needed simplicity." -- Warren Berger, Bestselling author of <i>A More Beautiful Question</i><br><br>"Once again, Bodell hits the bullseye; this time with Why Simple Wins. She presents a compelling case that complexity is killing organizations--backed up with stone-cold data--and then delivers practical and effective tools to enable leaders to make simplification a habit. True to her message, Bodell conveys it all through the use of storytelling." - Camille Mirshokrai, Managing Director Leadership Development and Succession Planning, Accenture<br><br>"The most successful people I know are not the most busy: they're the ones who can cut through the clutter and focus their energies on what really matters. Knowing why and how to do that is essential for all us. In Why Simple Wins Lisa Bodell shines a bright light on how too often we create and collude in the frustrating, time wasting systems we rail against. In doing so, she makes a compelling - and simple - case for making simplification a habit, and she gives us the practical tools to do just that.

Akin, and Tony Merida, this new commentary series, projected to be 48 volumes, takes a Christ- centered approach to expositing each book of the Bible. Rather than a verse-by-verse approach, the authors have crafted chapters that explain and apply key passages in their assigned Bible books. Readers will learn to see Christ in all aspects of Scripture, and they will be encouraged by the devotional nature of each exposition. Projected contributors to the series include notable authors such as Russell D. Moore, Al Mohler, Matt Chandler, Francis Chan, Mark Dever, and others.</p><p><p><b>Thabiti M.

It's one thing to be aware of the story's many heroes; it's another to have met the Hero himself. From the Old Testament that anticipates him, to the Gospels that manifest him, to the Book of Acts that proclaims him, to the Epistles that explain him, and to the Book of Revelation that tells of him coming again, your Bible is about Jesus. That's why I love the vision of the <i>Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary</i> series.

All hands to the roof of Shark House!&#x201d; Marc Lee&#x2019;s breathless bark snapped me out of sleep.<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t think as I jolted off my cot, stuck my bare feet in my Oakley boots, and grabbed my web gear, machine gun, helmet, and night-vision goggles (NVGs). I ran hot on Marc&#x2019;s heels, in nothing but a pair of PT shorts and some assault gear, as we raced the hundred yards to the roof like sharks toward blood in the water.<br><br> Impending violence permeated the Euphrates&#x2019;s musty breeze.<br><br> &#x201c;Muj swimmers trying to attack Blue Diamond,&#x201d; Marc called over his shoulder as we hit the ground-floor entrance to the house. Camp Blue Diamond was the Marine base across the river to our east. We bounded up the stairs, untied boot laces whipping our bare shins. On the roof, we joined about twenty other Teamguys, most of us in PT shorts and bare chested, the unofficial uniform for middle-of-the-night, just-out-of-your-rack muj hunting. I saw an occasional T-shirt and had to stifle a chuckle when I noticed Guy, one of our officers, and his perfect uniform. A hodgepodge of support guys intermixed among us. When Marc said all hands, he had meant all hands. Everybody wanted to get his war on.<br><br> The muj had sent a sorry contingent of maritime fighters to attack the Marine base. Blue Diamond had alerted our tactical operations center (TOC), who in turn had coordinated the perfect L-shaped ambush. We stood poised, waiting for the green light from our base defense operations center on Camp Ramadi. Our mismatched uniforms and patchwork appearance belied our deadly potential. We stood, silently, vipers waiting to strike.<br><br> Somebody was going to have a bad night.<br><br> Guy was on my left. Marc Lee and Ryan Job fell in alongside him. JP was to my right. We were new to war, but our brotherhood spanned many generations and was forged by a proud warrior tradition. We were ready.<br><br> A few spots to my right, a support guy named Neal was armed to the teeth. I stifled another chuckle. His gear was an arsenal of grenades, M4 mags, and trinkets. He had no NVGs. I turned my attention back across the quiet river. My night vision infiltrated the darkness, and I could see movement. I pushed the safety off on my gun and turned on my infrared laser.<br><br> Then the command came.<br><br> Three, two, one. Execute.<br><br> Together, we unleashed hell on the river below and the unsuspecting muj lurking in its waters. It was euphoric. I methodically delivered 150 rounds in precise eight-to-ten-round bursts. The tracers screamed across the water. Some hit and stuck; others deflected and fizzled into the night. The intense energy of American ordnance and thunder of machine guns singing all around left no doubt in my mind: I was born for this.<br><br> I looked around me at every other man doing exactly the same thing and realized that this is how it had always been. Since the first man threw a rock, to when a man chucked a spear, to when another man aimed his rifle, it has come down to a man, his weapon, and the brothers who will fight with him. At that moment, everyone who mattered to me was on that rooftop. Nothing existed beyond Ramadi. These were the men who would bring me out alive, as I would them. I had literally nothing but my gun and my brothers. I hope it will always be like this.<br><br> I didn&#x2019;t notice my scalding-hot shell casing ejecting toward JP&#x2019;s exposed leg to my right. I didn&#x2019;t care. When the abrupt call to cease fire finally came, my ears rang, my hands tingled, and the enemy was dead or dying. I felt alive.<br><br> Someone was yelling at Neal for firing six mags at the enemy with no night vision on. We called him Shadow Stalker for the rest of the deployment. A gunner&#x2019;s mate tech asked sheepishly, &#x201c;Hey, man, am I going to get my Combat Action Ribbon for this?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure, man,&#x201d; I said, deciding to let him revel in his glory for a little while.<br><br> I checked my left flank. Guy, Marc, and Ryan had the familiar look of satisfaction that operating a powerful weapon delivers. JP cussed the burns on his left calf from my brass. I shrugged and took a deep breath. The smell of cordite from hundreds of spent rounds mixed with a breeze from the Euphrates&#x2019;s ancient waters. I put my gun on safe and hit the pressure pad for the laser. I grabbed my gear and began the walk back to my tent, wondering how many similar opportunities I&#x2019;d have like this over the next seven months. I didn&#x2019;t want it to change me, or us&#x2014;any of us. I didn&#x2019;t think ahead to the future&#x2014;where I&#x2019;d be as a man or a husband or father a decade later. It didn&#x2019;t matter at the time. I just needed to clean my gun. I was in Ramadi, and I&#x2019;d be back in my rack before the flies found the meat we&#x2019;d left for them in the reeds.<br><br> Later, I lay awake for only a moment before falling into a satisfied sleep, confident in the work I&#x2019;d done with the others.<br><br><i>I hope it will always be like this.</i></p><h2>Beehive Alchemy: Projects and recipes using honey, beeswax, propolis, and pollen to make soap, candles, creams, salves, and more</h2><p><b>From crayons to cough drops, cookies to candles, <i>Beehive Alchemy </i>offers a comprehensive introduction to&nbsp;incorporating the miracle of bees into everyday life.</b><br><br><i>Beehive Alchemy</i> is a&nbsp;continuation of Petra Ahnert's best-selling <i>Beeswax Alchemy</i>.

At first, !, a round circle with a face, doesn&#x2019;t like standing out in a crowd; in a line-up of seven smiling faces, which look like period marks, he&#x2019;s the only one with a line above his head. ! tries clever ways to fit in (flipping himself upside down, thereby squashing his tail) and even thinks about running away, until he meets a formidable force: the question mark.

Pre-readers and readers alike will giggle and cheer to see the process. The setting is a warm yellowish beige background with a faint pulpy pattern and repeating horizontal lines with dotted lines halfway between them&#x2014;penmanship paper. Each bold, black punctuation mark has a minimalist yet expressive face inside its circular dot. &#x201c;He stood out,&#x201d; explains the first page, as the titular protagonist looks on doubtfully. He tries hanging around with periods, but squishing his extension down into a spring doesn&#x2019;t really work; even prostrate, &#x201c;he just wasn&#x2019;t like everyone else. Period.&#x201d; (Hee! Rosenthal gleefully puns instead of naming any punctuation.) Mournful, &#x201c;confused, flummoxed, and deflated,&#x201d; the exclamation mark&#x2019;s line tangles and flops. Then someone unexpected arrives. &#x201c;Hello? Who are you?&#x201d; queries the newbie, jovially pummeling the exclamation mark with 17 manic inquiries at once. &#x201c;<b>Stop!</b>&#x201d; screams the exclamation mark in enormous, bumpy-edged letters&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s his identity! The outburst&#x2019;s anxious vibe dissipates immediately (and the question mark is undaunted by being yelled at). Finally, the protagonist has &#x201c;[broken] free from a life sentence.&#x201d; Snapping up usages that match his newfound personality, he zooms back to show the other punctuation marks. The zippy relationship between exclamation mark and question mark continues beyond the acknowledgements page." - <i>Kirkus </i>starred review</p><p>&nbsp;<br>"Through a perfect pairing of clever design and tongue-in-cheek humor, Rosenthal and Lichtenheld effectively demonstrate the function of the exclamation mark (as well as the period and question mark) in this tale about a depressed punctuation mark that just doesn&#x2019;t fit in. On an unadorned backdrop of lined paper, several periods and one exclamation mark are lined up in a row. Clearly, he stands out in a crowd. Like Elmer in David McKee&#x2019;s classic tale, the exclamation mark struggles with his difference and tries to blend in. When the downcast punctuation meets a question mark who overwhelms him with inquiries, our hero finally finds his voice and tells the other to &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; From there, he builds his confidence in making declarative statements and leaves the group &#x201c;to make his mark.&#x201d; Rosenthal shines in her play on words (&#x201c;It was like he broke free from a life sentence&#x201d;). Lichtenheld&#x2019;s minimalist style is deceivingly simple; a curlicue or crumpled line, combined with an amazingly impressive circle with eyes and a mouth, is all that&#x2019;s needed to convey emotion when the exclamation mark is &#x201c;confused, flummoxed, and deflated.&#x201d; This fun-to-read tale will find a ready home in language-arts lessons, reminding burgeoning elementary-age writers which punctuation personality belongs in which type of sentence<i>&#x2013;</i>without the tedium that accompanies traditional grammar lessons.

Readers will see that the teachings will reside in biblical verses and God&#39;s viewpoint of how wives are to be for Him as well as their husbands. Several important aspects of being a wife are discussed, using the authors&#39; personal stories and memories to shape what God&#39;s approach to marriage and what our human approach is to marriage. The contrasting viewpoints will resonate with readers, as we wish to adopt a Christ like character in marriage but we typically lead with the flesh-focused character.

But what does this engagement actually look like? How can local churches train, send, and support missionaries well? Unpacking principles from the Bible and applying them in the context of real life in a local church, this new book in the 9Marks: Building Healthy Churches series is filled with practical steps and advice for supporting missionaries, forming international partnerships, sending short-term teams, and engaging with the nations here at home. This book casts a vision for the local church as the engine of world missions&#x2015;for the joy of all people and the glory of God.</p></p><p><p>Pastor-Teacher, McLean Bible Church; author,&nbsp;<em>Radical: Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dream</em></p><p>&#x201c;What a helpful book! Andy Johnson has a clear eye on the gospel as he helps us think through the basic principles a sending church needs to have in place before anyone leaves for the field. Drawing on years of experience as a missions pastor, Andy skillfully and winsomely tackles what it means to have healthy mission partnerships. He then helps us think through a number of modern missionary issues: short terms, the international church, and more. I long for every church with a shred of missions interest to read and apply this book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>J. Mack Stiles,</strong>&nbsp;pastor; author, <em>Evangelism</em> and <em>Marks of the Messenger</em></p><p> &#x201c;I am grateful for Johnson&#x2019;s wise, sensitive, and practical insights for the local church committed to going global. While written by a North American, this book is neither culturally bound nor ethnocentrically blind. The issues addressed apply to any healthy local church anywhere in the world. In other words, <i>Missions</i> is thoroughly biblical. And for this reason, those like me who minister in another culture will find its lessons doable. I heartily recommend it, praying that God will grant it a wide readership, for his global glory.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Doug Van Meter,</strong>&nbsp;Pastor-Teacher, Brackenhurst Baptist Church, Johannesburg, South Africa</p><p>&#x201c;I love this book. I love the way it begins and ends with the glory of God in the gospel. I love the way it places the local church at the center of both sending missionaries and the task of mission. I love the way it&#x2019;s driven by biblical principles yet full of practical advice. All the ingredients are here to transform the place of world missions in your congregation. World mission is our responsibility, your responsibility.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Tim Chester,</strong> Pastor, Grace Church Boroughbridge, North Yorkshire; Faculty Member, Crosslands Training</p><p>&#x201c;Andy Johnson&#x2019;s plain-spoken book is rooted in Scripture and informed by his wealth of experience both in pastoral ministry and in many forward-operating bases of gospel advance. This book answers a plea for help I often hear from churches that want their missions program to be more than a line item in the budget or a map filled with pins. This book helps churches to effectively and joyfully engage in God&#x2019;s worldwide mission!&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Tim Keesee,</strong>&nbsp;Executive Director, Frontline Missions International; author, <em>Dispatches from the Front: Stories of Gospel Advance in the World&#x2019;s Difficult Places</em></p><p>&#x201c;Johnson has given the church a gift in this practical guidebook for launching, sending, and sustaining missional endeavors in your local church. Every believer should read this book!&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Robby Gallaty,</strong>&nbsp;Lead Pastor,&nbsp;Long Hollow Baptist Church, Hendersonville, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;In an increasingly post-Christian society, you may feel the mission pinch. How can we give our time, energy, attention, finances, and personnel to global missions when the needs are so great, and growing, here at home? If you feel buried in local needs, this short book may be exactly what you need to lift your head to God&#x2019;s international work and glory, open your eyes to the global cause in which we minister, and expand your heart to be more like his. Perhaps what your busy and bruised church needs is precisely a vision and passion for what God is up to around the world and not just around the corner. Cultivating a heart for God&#x2019;s global glory and sending our best people and resources into his cause will not detract from ministry at home. It will make it powerful and real.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David Mathis,</strong> Executive Editor, desiringGod.org; Pastor, Cities Church, Saint Paul, Minnesota; author, <em>Habits of Grace: Enjoying Jesus through the Spiritual Disciplines</em></p><p>&#x201c;Andy Johnson has given us a doctrinally sound yet highly practical blueprint to guide the local church in going global in the twenty-first century. I pray that this volume will be widely circulated among pastors and lay leaders.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Al Jackson,</strong>&nbsp;Pastor, Lakeview Baptist Church, Auburn, Alabama</p><p>&#x201c;This book is biblical, thoughtful, challenging, encouraging, and gospel-centered. I really appreciate the way Andy Johnson emphasizes two main points: (1) the Great Commission continues to be the priority of the plan of redemption, and (2) pastors of local churches and their members must embrace this call because it is their primary responsibility rather than the role of missionary agencies. In addition, Johnson helps churches know how to make the missionary enterprise more Bible-based and therefore more God-honoring. The application of the teachings of this book should revolutionize the long- and short-term mission programs of most local churches.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Miguel N��ez,</strong> Senior Pastor, International Baptist Church, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Founding President, Wisdom &amp; Integrity Ministries</p><p>&#x201c;As a pastor, I could not be more thankful for this book by Andy Johnson. Although books on missions abound, this one fills a void felt by any local church trying to discern how best to be involved in taking the gospel to the nations. Not only does it lay a much-needed foundation and framework for missions; it also answers the practical questions that inevitably arise. Both challenging and helpful, particularly for local church leaders, it is the book I&#x2019;ve been looking for since I first began my pastoral ministry. I will make it available and encourage every member to read it.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>J. Josh Smith,</strong>&nbsp;Lead Pastor, MacArthur Blvd. Baptist Church, Irving, Texas</p><p>&#x201c;A seasoned missions pastor, Johnson hands out insightful, practical guidance to help churches reshape their missions strategies more biblically and faithfully. Especially valuable is his emphasis on the role of the local church, too often underplayed in missions circles today. I will eagerly hand this book out to all our church leaders and missionaries.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>John Folmar,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, The United Church of Dubai</p><p>&#x201c;The church has been tasked with the mission of making disciples of all nations. Too often the local church is pulled in several directions without a clear guiding vision for its mission efforts. As a pastor, I am grateful for Andy Johnson&#x2019;s book because it helps church leaders to develop a plan for their mission pursuits that is well-intentioned instead of ambiguous and proactive instead of reactionary. I highly recommend this book to all church leaders who desire a well-thought-out vision for engaging the nations with the gospel.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Afshin Ziafat</strong>, Lead Pastor, Providence Church, Frisco, Texas</p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Missions</i>, Andy Johnson argues that the church glorifies God not only in working to gather true worshipers from all peoples, but also in using the means he has outlined in Scriptures to fulfill those ends. Because there is much debate about what missions is, how to do missions, and who is a missionary, Johnson spends a great part of the book helping us find answers that are rooted in scriptural commands, examples, and principles. If you desire to do missions in a way that only God gets the glory, you&#x2019;ll want to read this book and pass it around to others who love God and love to see unbelieving people become followers of Jesus Christ.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<strong>Juan R.

To her horror, she discovers that they can only afford to live in the notorious poverty-stricken tenements. Seamus becomes obsessed with republican politics, neglecting his lucrative craft. And, as Dublin is plunged into chaos and turmoil at Easter 1916, Betty gives birth to her first child to the sound of gunfire and shelling.But Betty vows that she will survive war and want, and move her little family out of the tenements.Nothing will stand in her way.

Born during the Easter Rising, she has lived through some of the country's most turbulent times. The daughter of a spirited woman and gifted violin-maker, the memories come to life when she hears the music of her past.</p><p> Dublin 1916 and Betty is about to give birth, alone. Irish rebels are taking over the city and she fears for her husband's safety. Huddled in a tenement building, close to the GPO, she vows to improve her circumstances, with or without her husband's consent.</p><p> Ireland's battle for Independence has been the subject of many novels in recent months. The brave men and women of our nation have been re-worked into some fine narratives and every child in the country celebrated this years centenary. Olive Collins has added on something extra by bringing the story forward. From the Rebellion, subsequent executions and treaty negotiations through to the end of civil war and its bitter aftermath. She uses Betty, Isabel and their extended family to show how determination can sometimes lead to despair. Betty's husband Seamus is a gifted man, full of musical talent and is an unparalleled creator of exquisite violins. However, his Republican values outweigh his love of his personal life and he becomes increasingly distant from his family. Late night visits, hidden arms and secret societies become the norm and Betty fears for her future. Her hardened determination results in her own secrets. As the years slip by, the female descendants of Betty are unaware of the murky details of their matriarch's early years, until the discovery of some hidden letters...</p><p> Historical fiction can sometimes be weighed down by the authors research and the characters can become victims of their historical relevance. This is not so with The Memory of Music. While it is obvious that the author has an intensive knowledge of 20thC Irish History, especially the years surrounding our desire to break from English rule, she does not drown the reader with facts. Rather, she gives enough detail to relate the characters to their situations and leaves the reader with a taster that may result in further research, if desired. A teaser, if you like. The writing is fluid and clear, with the novel split into three parts; the first part centered around the events of 1916, the second on Treaty negotiations and the War of Independence, whilst the final part leads the novel towards current times. There are a gaggle of female, cross-generational characters in part three and I found myself struggling to retain their relevance to Seamus and Betty's story. The idea of discovered letters is nothing new, but add in some torn photos and antique violins and furniture and it ups the game. This is a great read, ideal for fans of Marita Conlon-McKenna's Rebel Sisters or RT�'s recent TV drama, Rebellion. A very worthy debut, ideally timed for the 1916 centenary celebrations and the upcoming anniversary of the War of Independence. --Bleach House Library<br><br>The Memory of Music was a poignant story about an Irish family, the women of whom were ahead of their time. I loved the independence of Betty and was heartbroken at the story of Isabel and her dementia. At least she had her music to calm her in her last days. --Amazon Reviewer</p></p><h2>Bear (The Puppy Place #14)</h2><p><b>Welcome to the Puppy Place--where every puppy finds a home!</b><br><br>10-year-old Lizzie Peterson and her family are on an adventurous winter vacation in snowy Vermont when she meets Bear, an adorable husky called lazy and then abandoned by his sled-dog racing team.

Most hospitals deal with this by pur�eing their food. The unfortunate result is that food becomes unappetizing, and patients fail to obtain the nutrition they need. Now, nutritionists Sandra Woodruff and Leah Gilbert-Henderson have written the <i><strong>Soft Foods for Easier Eating Cookbook</strong>, </i>an easy-to-follow guide that offers maximum nutrition and taste with minimum discomfort.<br><br>Part One highlights simple strategies for living with chewing and swallowing difficulties, and offers guidelines for modifying recipes for soft and smooth texture, and to increase or decrease calories, fat, and carbohydrates. Part Two presents<strong> over 150 recipes</strong> for smashing smoothies, sumptuous soups, hearty entr�es, and more. Information on nutrition and texture accompany each recipe, making it easy to find dishes that satisfy both your dietary needs and your love of good food.</p></p><p><p><em>Sandra Woodruff, MS, RD, LD/N,</em> has a master&#x2019;s of science in food and nutrition from Florida State University.

Whether the problem is long-term or only temporary, it will require change and the ability to learn and accept a new way of eating. This book was written to help you through this challenging period and to convince you that chewing or swallowing difficulties do <i>not </i>mean the end of good-tasting food, nor do they mean hours of slaving in the kitchen. Easy-to eat dishes can also be easy to prepare and easy to enjoy. This book will show you how it&#x2019;s done.<br><br>You will be amazed by the variety of tastes and visual delights that can be created while keeping it smooth. Hospitals frequently make pur�ed diets by simply putting whatever they are cooking for their main course into a food processor. They may add a little liquid and thickener, but otherwise, they are simply blending a food that we don&#x2019;t normally eat in pur�ed form. Because the results are not very appetizing, people often refuse these foods even when chewing or swallowing problems make a special diet necessary. But if you avoid foods that are easily eaten and digested, you may be unable to maintain a healthy weight and give your body the best chance of healing.<br><br>There is an alternative. You can compensate for the variety you lose in texture by emphasizing a range of tastes and colors. Throughout the world, countless dishes featured in gourmet restaurants are not only soft or smooth in texture, but also rich in both taste and visual appeal. This book will show you simple ways to create delicious and appetizing foods so you can more fully enjoy eating.<br><br>Part One of this book highlights basic strategies for living with <i>dysphagia, </i>or difficulty in swallowing, as well as other problems that require a mechanically altered diet. You will learn about the conditions that can benefit from a soft or smooth diet, and you will find tips for dealing with added difficulties such as nausea, diminished appetite, and altered taste. You will then learn how to stock your pantry and equip your kitchen so that you can make soft and smooth foods with ease&#x2015;and, when necessary, at a moment&#x2019;s notice. Part One also includes special sections on pur�eing and thickening, simple techniques that you may need to master not only as you follow the recipes in this book, but also as you convert family favorites into easy-to-eat dishes. Finally, you&#x2019;ll find guidelines that will help you keep your diet healthy as you meet your special needs.<br><br>Part Two puts principles into practice with <strong>over 150 delicious soft and smooth recipes</strong> that cater to a wide range of tastes and dietary needs.

Watching the world he knew vanish in a trucker&#x2019;s rearview mirror, he thought he was leaving an unspeakable nightmare behind forever. But years later, the bright new future he&#x2019;s built suddenly turns pitch black, as something fiendishly familiar looms dead ahead. </p><p>When Jack, his wife Aimee, and their two small children survive a violent car crash, it seems like a miracle. But Jack knows what he saw on the road that night, and it wasn&#x2019;t divine intervention. The profound evil from his past won&#x2019;t let them die...at least not quickly. It&#x2019;s back, and it&#x2019;s hungry; ready to make Jack pay for running, to work its malignant magic on his angelic youngest daughter, and to whisper a chilling promise: <i>I&#x2019;ve always been here, and I&#x2019;ll never leave.</i> </p><p>Country comfort is no match for spine-tingling Southern gothic suspense in Ania Ahlborn&#x2019;s tale of an ordinary man with a demon on his back. <i>Seed</i> plants its page-turning terror deep in your soul, and lets it grow wild.</p></p><p><p>Born in Ciechan�w, Poland, Ania Ahlborn is also the author of the upcoming thriller <i>The Neighbors</i>, and is currently at work on her third novel. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from the University of New Mexico, and enjoys gourmet cooking, baking, drawing, traveling, and watching movies, as well as terrifying readers with her macabre tales. She currently resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with her husband and two dogs.</p>"Incorporating elements from such genre classics as The Exorcist, Poltergeist, and Bad Seed, but telling its own story, this horror novel contains moments of genuine terror that should stick with readers long after they&#x2019;ve finished the book. The story seems simple enough: Jack and his family (wife Aimee, daughters Abby and Charlie) survive a car accident, but afterward, six-year-old Charlie seems to change, to take on a new and frightening personality. Aimee struggles to understand what&#x2019;s going on with her little girl, but Jack already knows: the horror that came to him when he was a child has found him again. Ahlborn doesn&#x2019;t pull any punches here, delivering a story that is atmospheric and brutal, with an ending that is absolutely correct and absolutely horrifying. Genre fans should be enthusiastically pointed in this novel&#x2019;s direction."<br>&nbsp;&#x2014; David Pitt</p><h2>The Women&#39;s Guide to Golf: A Handbook for Beginners</h2><p><p>Throughout her teaching career, Kellie Stenzel has been continually asked to recommend a beginning golf instruction book for her female students to read. She researched the market and found nothing suitable--most books are too technical for the beginner and assume that the reader already has some familiarity with the game. This became the inspiration for <i>The Women's Guide to Golf</i>, a well-crafted and easy-to-understand golf instructional for women who are new to the game.</p><p>Each section of the book provides a complete explanation of the skills needed to play golf. Ideas are presented in a clear and simple manner--golf lingo is translated into every-day English whenever possible so the reader can easily understand. Since students must have an idea of what they are trying to accomplish before they can learn, Kellie Stenzel starts at the very beginning and gives detailed explanations of basic concepts. For example, she explains what a putter looks like, what a putting green looks like, and what the goal of putting is, before teaching the reader how to putt. In addition, since women's learning style is very different from men's, this book also addresses specific women's issues, such as posture and lack of distance.</p><p>This book includes</p><p>- a thorough explanation of the game<br>- easy-to-understand instructions<br>- suggestions on how to avoid embarrassment as a beginner<br>- simple ways to remember what you've read<br>- great anecdotes from the author's experiences as a golfer and a teacher<br>- over 75 black-and-white photos</p><p><i>The Women's Guide to Golf</i> is one of the most accessible and comprehensive golf instructionals ever written for women--it is the perfect book for any woman who wants to learn the game.</p></p><p>Kellie Stenzel Garvin, a PGA and LPGA class-A teaching professional, has been golfing since she was 3 years old. In her book, <i>The Women's Guide to Golf</i>, she attempts to teach the woman golfer who has not. Assuming the reader has no prior knowledge of the game, she explains everything. The chapters are set up as lessons, the first ones covering the course, the ball, the hole, and the equipment. The simplicity of these first lessons may seem a little insulting--after all, a beginning golfer is not the same as a beginning reader. But when she discusses grip in lesson 5, pay attention--that's when Stenzel Garvin starts to shine. With the aid of 75 black-and-white photos, she takes the novice golfer through the basic points of putting and the short game before moving on to the full swing. Two of the most valuable lessons aimed at helping the beginner avoid the pitfalls that would make her stand out: step-by-step instructions for going to the driving range to hit a bucket of balls and playing a round of golf. "Fake it 'til you make it" is her mantra. Left-handed golfers be warned, this book is written strictly from a right-handed perspective, so all instructions will have to be translated. <i>--Suzanne Sexton</i><p><b>Kellie Stenzel</b> is a PGA class A teaching professional who teaches at the Atlantic Golf Club in Bridgehampton, New York, and at The Breakers in Palm Beach, Florida.

In <i>Work Clean,</i> Dan Charnas reveals how to apply mise-en-place outside the kitchen, in any kind of work. <br><br>Culled from dozens of interviews with culinary professionals and executives, including world-renowned chefs like Thomas Keller and Alfred Portale, this essential guide offers a simple system to focus your actions and accomplish your work. Charnas spells out the 10 major principles of mise-en-place for chefs and non chefs alike: (1) planning is prime; (2) arranging spaces and perfecting movements; (3) cleaning as you go; (4) making first moves; (5) finishing actions; (6) slowing down to speed up; (7) call and callback; (8) open ears and eyes; (9) inspect and correct; (10) total utilization. <br><br>This journey into the world of chefs and cooks shows you how each principle works in the kitchen, office, home, and virtually any other setting.</p><p>Dan Charnas is an award-winning culture, lifestyle, and business writer. Recipient of the 2007 Pulitzer Fellowship for Arts Journalism, his first book, <i>The Big Payback: The History of the Business of Hip-Hop,</i> was called &#x201c;a classic of music-business dirt digging as well as a kind of pulp epic&#x201d; by <i>Rolling Stone. </i>He lives in New York City.FOCUS<br><br>How mise-en-place works<br><br>CHEF DWAYNE LIPUMA'S entire kitchen staff just quit. He's looking at reservations for 40 people for lunch, then another 140 for a banquet tomorrow. To make all those meals, LiPuma's bosses have provided him with 19 recruits, some of whom have never cooked in a fine-dining restaurant. Aside from LiPuma's assistant and a pastry chef, not one of the staff has ever seen the menu, much less prepared the items on it, all gourmet dishes with elaborate presentations.<br><br>But by the end of the day, the diners will leave satisfied. In fact, the customers--some of whom have waited months for a reservation at LiPuma's restaurant, American Bounty--will scarcely notice that their entire meal was made by neophyte cooks.<br><br>A miracle perhaps? Nope. It's a regular day for Chef LiPuma. In 3 weeks, when LiPuma has his crew trained and confident, they will leave and a new group of inexperienced cooks will replace them. He will repeat this process every 3 weeks, thus providing the penultimate course for students who will soon graduate from the Culinary Institute of America.<br><br>What makes this impossible rhythm possible is not a miracle. It's a system called mise-en-place.<br><br>LEARNING TO COOK, LEARNING TO WORK<br><br>The Culinary Institute of America, called the CIA without irony by people who think more about the epicurean than they do espionage, sits like a citadel on the banks of the Hudson River almost 100 miles north of New York City. Its grand campus in Hyde Park, New York, centered around a former seminary--housing an average of 2,400 students, 140 full-time faculty, 49 kitchens, and four student-staffed restaurants--the CIA is among the world's most renowned culinary schools, with branches in Texas, northern California, and Singapore.<br><br>From the first day of classes to the last, CIA students will hear the term mise-en-place, pronounced like "me's on plahhs." It's on the lips of Tim Ryan, the president of the college, as he greets new enrollees. A few of the students may have heard the term before they arrived, perhaps in a kitchen for which they worked during high school or thereafter. Some will refer to their textbook, The Professional Chef, which provides the English translation of the term, "put in place," and a definition: "the preparation and assembly of ingredients, pans, utensils, and plates or serving pieces needed for a particular dish or service period." At first, mise-en-place blends into the dozens of French words and phrases they must remember as they make their way through their introductory class, Culinary Fundamentals, like mirepoix, brunoise, tourner, arroser, fond de veau, roux, consomm�. But as students learn the basic techniques they'll need to succeed in all the courses that follow--knife cuts, making stock, making sauce, cooking vegetables and meat--they learn that mise-en-place encompasses an entirely different set of vital skills, and that putting their ingredients and tools in place is just the first level of a deceptively simple concept that keeps unfolding.<br><br>Instructors invoke mise-en-place when they tell students to keep their cutting boards and workstations clean and when they tell them to arrange their tools in a certain order and return them to that order after they use them; when they move too slow and also when they move too fast; when they move too much and when they move too little; when they start tasks too early and when they finish them too late; when they talk too much and when they don't say enough; when they don't use their five senses: taste, touch, smell, sight, sound; and when they fail to use their sixth sense: common. As the days go by, the chef-instructors begin to talk about a deeper notion: mental mise-en-place, the idea that students can't master physical organization without first organizing their minds. It starts with the CIA timeline, a paper form that chefs expect students to use every day and master. In preparation for each class, students must list their needed tools, ingredients, and tasks for the day. They must arrange those tasks in time, plotting precisely when each thing is supposed to happen. When students find themselves running behind in class or skipping steps, the chefs refer to the student's timeline; usually the chefs can point to the error in thinking that resulted in the error in behavior. Students commit these timelines to memory. Then they begin to tackle planning on-the-fly, the mental work that allows them to move smoothly from one task to the next. Over time, mise-en-place begins to reveal itself as a set of values: Apprenticing oneself. Getting to class early, not just on time. Working with intensity. Cultivating a sense of urgency. Remaining alert. Aiming for perfection.<br><br>This idea of mise-en-place, a curriculum unto itself, begins to migrate outside the kitchen. Students load their backpacks and lay their clothes out at night before bed, iron their chef's whites and shine their shoes. They use timelines and prep lists to study for their academic courses, not just their cooking classes. They organize their desks, their closets, their rooms. They even begin "mise-en-placing" their social activities to maximize their time off.<br><br>Then the students go home for their first holiday and wonder how the rest of the world changed so much since they were last in it.<br><br>Maybe, like Alexandra Tibbats, they watch their parents scurry around the house for car keys that should, of course, have been put back where they belonged, or wait hours for high school friends who can't seem to show up on time. Or maybe they're like Kaitlin Ngo, whose mother watches in stunned silence as Kaitlin--for whom the opening of a suitcase had always been comparable to the uncorking of a geyser--now demurs on a quick shopping excursion to stay home and methodically unpack.<br><br>The students return to the CIA and learn to cook � la carte breakfasts, lunches, and dinners for their classmates. At the end of their first year, they go on their "externship"--18 weeks working in a restaurant in the real world. Some will cook; others will do the kinds of jobs that kitchen trainees are expected to do: working in the prep kitchen, cutting vegetables and cleaning. They will marvel at how fast and smooth everyone around them seems to move, confirming how much they still don't know. As their second year draws to a close, they will be assigned to one of the CIA's four first-class restaurants, and the training wheels come off. Some of them will enter the kitchen of American Bounty and be greeted by a smiling Chef Dwayne LiPuma.<br><br>But LiPuma is not here to assess their cooking skills because they've learned and been evaluated on all their techniques already. What LiPuma will be teaching and testing here is their physical, mental, and ethical mise-en-place, without which they will never be able to use any of those techniques in a professional setting.<br><br>WELCOME TO AMERICAN BOUNTY<br><br>Nineteen students dressed in clean chef whites gather in a wood-paneled private dining room next to the lobby-bar of American Bounty. It's 7:45 a.m. when Chef Dwayne LiPuma walks in for the first day of class. For the next 75 minutes he'll lecture them on the daily work schedule and the rules of the kitchen, review the menu dish-by-dish, and describe how he'll grade them. LiPuma is 5 feet 6 inches of compacted power, with spiky brown hair and metal-rimmed glasses. He talks fast, very fast, Martin Scorcese-on-a- double-espresso fast.<br><br>"Welcome to American Bounty," he says. "We are going into the whirlwind. Your anxiety level is off the chart. Everybody's except for mine."<br><br>LiPuma is calm because he has his own mise-en-place. He's done everything he can to ensure the success of his new charges. He ordered the previous class to prepare a few days' worth of ingredients so the new class won't have to do any physical mise-en-place except for arranging those ingredients. LiPuma tells them they can ease their fears by getting the lay of the land--a "plan" in the literal sense of the term, the French word for "map." Make a mental diagram of where everything is and should be. Know the recipes. And come to class every day with your timeline. "No timeline means 20 percent off your daily grade," he warns. He knows that when they get into the professional world, these students won't write timelines. Instead they'll internalize them.<br><br>"I'm not going to teach you how to cut a carrot," he tells them. "I'm going to teach you how to organize yourself."<br><br>It's one thing to apply cooking techniques to a recipe and construct a plate. It is quite another thing to do that a dozen times with speed and consistency. LiPuma argues that organization is going to deliver the speed they'll need. Speed will come from their brain's basal ganglia memorizing repeated muscle movements, which--if they are to be quick--should be as small as possible. They will gain some of that speed by selecting their tools with care. "What kind of ladle do you need for the soup?" LiPuma asks. "An 8-ounce ladle. Why? Because that's the portion size." If students have a 2-ounce ladle, they will have to ladle four times instead of one. They will win additional speed by arranging their tools. "I should be able to blindfold you," the chef says, "and when I say, 'Pick up your tongs,' you know that they're always right there, that your ladle is right there, that your oil is right here." They will accrue even more speed by properly arranging their ingredients. LiPuma wants all their ingredients "zoned out": all the ingredients for one dish in one area. "The less your hand moves, the more efficient you are."<br><br>"You'll see," he continues. "By being organized, you will be more efficient. By being more efficient, you will have more time in your day. By having more time in your day, you will be more relaxed in your day; you will be able to accomplish the task at hand in a clear, concise, fluid motion." LiPuma promises them that by the time they leave his kitchen, they'll be smooth and calm, like him.<br><br>"Like oil on glass," he says.<br><br>DAY ONE<br><br>The students enter the kitchen at 9:00 a.m. They have 1 hour to produce "demo plates"--one sample dish of every menu item on their station. Each student is responsible for two or three menu items. On tougher stations students work in pairs. The demo plates give them a chance to practice before service and give LiPuma a peek at their skills: Can they actually do the cooking?<br><br>At 10:00 a.m., once their demos are done, they take a break for "family meal," prepared by a team of three students. Chef LiPuma kicks everyone out of the kitchen and doesn't let them back in until 11:00 a.m. "They need to decompress," LiPuma says. "They get so stressed out. And sometimes when you leave the scenario that's stressing you out--Oh, God! I've got all this work!--and you step back, eat something, rethink it, and revisit it, it's not so stressful. Plus, they need to eat, period. Because they'll skip eating, leave here, and they'll have nowhere to eat until dinner."<br><br>But while his students decompress in the dining room, LiPuma compresses their time in the kitchen. He doesn't want them to work through lunch and thus encourage a lazy pace. With cuisine as it is with culinary students, no transformation happens without heat. LiPuma needs to cook his class, too.<br><br>While they're eating, LiPuma and his sous-chefs-in-training straighten students' mise-en-place, writing reminders on the stainless steel tables with a black-ink Sharpie: "Your chervil is brown," "Paper towel under parsley," "Brush with olive oil." At 11:00 a.m. the students return. They have 45 minutes before the first lunch orders start coming in.<br><br>All morning, as the students work, Chef LiPuma prowls the "line"--the row of ovens, burners, and grills where most of his cooks stand and most of the kitchen's food gets prepared.<br><br>Some students use the wrong tools for the job: Zoe tries to cook potato pancakes in pans that are too big and use too much oil. Alex puts the butternut squash soup in a pot that's too small. "It's gonna burn," LiPuma says. Later Alex blots extra-virgin olive oil onto bruschetta with a paper towel. "Don't do that!" LiPuma moans. "Get a brush." Caitlyn discovers that the smashed potatoes left for her by the previous class have been put in a narrow, plastic quart container and have thus disintegrated under their own weight. "Why don't you make a necklace out of them?" LiPuma says. Caitlyn cooks replacement potatoes and puts them back in the same container, repeating the failure.<br><br>Other students don't check the ingredients prepared for them by the previous class: Rahmie places his own bruschetta in the oven to toast without noticing that there's no olive oil on them at all. "It doesn't matter that this is what they left you," Chef says. "You gotta make it right!"<br><br>With first day jitters, many students move too fast. "Juan!" Chef LiPuma says, seeing four cuts of steak on the grill. "What are you cooking all that beef for? When are you supposed to mark off that meat?"--meaning sear it so it acquires a nice crust and grill marks on the exterior before cooking to a finish in the oven. "When I come back from family meal," Juan replies. LiPuma nods: "So finish marking one. Easy there, Slick." When Juan and the others return from family meal, they continue to rush and confuse the proper order of things. They begin cooking side dishes well before the proteins are ready. "This is � la carte cooking, guys," LiPuma booms over the class PA system. "You cook your vegetables and starches on pickup," not when food is ordered. In other words, proteins get the heat when the order comes in, and when the chefs later call for pickup, that's when they heat the starches and vegetables, as they take less time. They remove meat from the oven when it's still raw. "Don't take anything out of the oven until you clear it with me first," LiPuma orders. The students bring warm plates down from the heat lamps well before their dishes are ready, letting them get cold. "If somebody plates on a cold plate again, zero for the day!" LiPuma bellows. "Are we clear?" "Yes, Chef!" the crew shouts.</p><h2>Fine Art Wire Weaving: Weaving Techniques for Stunning Jewelry Designs</h2><p>Wire jewelry has never been more popular--but you've never seen projects like this before!

That meant that as soon as I got the Celiac diagnosis from the doc and the no sugar, no grains marching orders from Vinnie, I went right out (online) and bought her book. Her recipes were interesting enough to get my attention but user-friendly enough to give me the confidence to try cooking them myself. Now, many of her meals are in heavy-rotation at my house and she even inspired me to start my own food blog - something I never dreamed of doing before. Anna is relatable. She's one of us. I can't wait to add more of her recipes to the rotation! - --Gina Grad<br><br>Anna Vocino's first cookbook, Eat Happy, was one of the first books that taught me my low carb ways. She cooks naturally, healthy, and of course with some fellow Italian flare. After learning her recipes, I couldn't wait for her to continue sharing her amazing cuisine, which she does exactly in Eat Happy Too. Because of Anna, I get to expand my Keto Guido ways even more. --Vinny Guadagnino The Keto Guido</p><h2>The Collected Short Stories of Louis L&#39;Amour, Volume 3: Frontier Stories</h2><p>In paperback for the first time, this third volume of Louis L&#x2019;Amour&#x2019;s collected stories gathers twenty-eight timeless tales of the American West.

Channeling ideas from sources as diverse as Picasso and Mexican surrealism, he rejected convention to develop his own way of seeing, interpreting, and expressing.</p><p>Pollock&#x2019;s most famous works are his drip paintings, where he dripped and poured household enamel paint over the canvas with a variety of instruments, from sticks to syringes, hardened brushes to broken bits of glass. The splattered results pulsate with energy, replacing the refinement of easel and brush with something altogether more immediate, vivid, and physical. To evade the viewer&#x2019;s search for figurative elements in his paintings, Pollock abandoned titles and identified each work with a neutral number only.</p><p>Notoriously reclusive and volatile, struggling with alcoholism, married to fellow Abstract Expressionist Lee Krasner, and killed in a car crash aged just 44, Pollock is as much a compelling celebrity icon as an artistic pioneer. This essential artist introduction explores both his work and his fame to shed light on masterpieces of the modernist story, and the making of a cultural icon.</p></p><p>Leonhard Emmerling received his doctorate from the University of Heidelberg for a thesis titled &#x201c;Jean Dubuffet&#x2019;s Art Theory.&#x201d; He is the Director of South Asia Programmes at the Goethe-Institute&#x2019;s office in New Delhi and was previously active as a curator at various art institutions in Germany. His publications include TASCHEN&#x2019;s Jean-Michel Basquiat and Jackson Pollock.</p><h2>Jean-Michel Basquiat</h2><p><p>The legend of Jean-Michel Basquiat is as strong as ever. Synonymous with New York in the 1980s, the artist first appeared in the late 1970s under the tag SAMO, spraying caustic comments and fragmented poems on the walls of the city. He appeared as part of a thriving underground scene of visual arts and graffiti, hip hop, post-punk, and DIY filmmaking, which met in a booming art world. As a painter with a strong personal voice, Basquiat soon broke into the established milieu, exhibiting in galleries around the world.</p><p>Basquiat&#x2019;s expressive style was based on raw figures and integrated words and phrases. His work is inspired by a pantheon of luminaries from jazz, boxing, and basketball, with references to arcane history and the politics of street life&#x2015;so when asked about his subject matter, Basquiat answered &#x201c;royalty, heroism and the streets.&#x201d; In 1983 he started collaborating with the most famous of art stars, Andy Warhol, and in 1985 was on the cover of The New York Times Magazine. When Basquiat died at the age of 27, he had become one of the most successful artists of his time.</p><p>This book allows an unprecedented insight into Basquiat&#x2019;s art, with pristine reproductions of his most seminal paintings, drawings, and notebook sketches. In large-scale format, the book offers vivid proximity to Basquiat&#x2019;s intricate marks and scribbled words, further illuminated by an introduction to the artist from editor Hans Werner Holzwarth, as well as an essay on his themes and artistic development from curator and art historian Eleanor Nairne. Richly illustrated year-by-year chapter breaks follow the artist&#x2019;s life and quote from his own statements and contemporary reviews to provide both personal background and historical context.</p></p><p>Eleanor Nairne is a curator at the Barbican Art Gallery. She has worked on a number of critically acclaimed exhibitions and publications, including Basquiat: Boom for Real (2017) and Imran Qureshi: Where the Shadows are so Deep (2016). Prior to the Barbican, she was curator of the Artangel Collection at Tate. She is a regular catalogue essayist, a writer for frieze, and a previous Jerwood Writer in Residence.<br><br>Hans Werner Holzwarth is a book designer and editor specializing in contemporary art and photography. His TASCHEN publications include Collector&#x2019;s Editions like Jeff Koons, Christopher Wool, Albert Oehlen, Ai Weiwei, and the David Hockney SUMO A Bigger Book, as well as monographs like the XXL-sized Jean-Michel Basquiat and survey books such as Modern Art and Art Now!

She is also the author of the critically acclaimed <em>Trout Summer</em> (an ALA Notable Children&#x2019;s Book and Best Book for Young Adults) and the Newbery Honor Book <em>Crazy Lady! </em> She lives in Baltimore, MD.</p>Grade 4-7 This sequel to Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (Atheneum, 1971), written by O'Brien's daughter, continues the NIMH saga with a focus on the second rodent generation: Timothy, Mrs. Frisby's son, and Racso, son of the rebel rat Jenner. On his way to classes at Thorn Valley, Timothy saves Racso's life but is himself severely injured. Both reach the Utopian colony only to discover that the valley and surrounding farms are to be turned into a tourist lake and campgrounds. Insecure and arrogant when he first arrives, Racso learns more than just how to read. In fact it is he who suggests a plan to save the colonysabotaging the dam site computer. Although the rats' plans fail, the dam opening is postponed by a heroic act of Racso's father. While the continuation of the NIMH story is most welcome, Conly's novel lacks the light touch of O'Brien's work, as well as the richness of character development and description. Timothy, for example, is too perfect a mouse to be very interesting, and the leader Nicodemus is often a tedious moralizer. Racso, on the other hand, is most appealing when he gets into trouble. Mrs. Frisby, Jeremy and Mr. Ages are unfortunately peripheral characters in this story. Conly sets the stage for the next sequel, for one reporter appears to believe that the computer was sabotaged by intelligent rats. Perhaps in the next installment, Racso's joie de vivre will rub off on the other rodents of Thorn Valley.Yvonne A.

She lives in San Francisco with her husband, Daniel Handler, and their son. <i>The Airport Book</i> is Lisa's second book for Roaring Brook Press.PreS-Gr 2-Nobody knows what's become of Monkey except the preschooler who packed him, tail protruding from the zipper of her suitcase. And so Brown begins this brilliant little book that weaves a Knuffle Bunny-esque narrative into an expository introduction to air travel. It's raining in the city, and a mixed-race family of four take a cab to the airport on their way to see the grandparents. The first page shows a single car on a long, flat drive to their destination, but the page turn opens up to the chaos of the airport itself. Brown bumps up our interest by following several groups of passengers as she takes readers through the procedures and places in an airport, from drop-off to pick-up. There's the soccer team, a cranky old woman and her complacent husband, and a family of look-alike redheads. At check-in, security, and the gate and on the plane, careful readers will notice Monkey making a parallel journey. Each page offers a simple narrative reflection of the India ink and watercolor illustrations in text small enough not to distract from the page's visual impact. Well-placed speech bubbles create personalities for an airport's vast cast. The girl and her monkey are reunited at the end of the trip, and readers have learned what to expect when they fly. Planes fascinate children, and there is no shortage of books to develop that interest. There's always room for one more, especially one this good.

Former president of Success Unlimited magazine, Mandino was the first recipient of the Napoleon Hill Gold Medal for literary achievement. Og Mandino was a member of the International Speakers Hall of Fame and honored with the Masters of Influence by the National Speakers Association. Og Mandino died in 1996, but his books continue to inspire countless thousands all over the world.There was only one other customer in Don June&#x2019;s Scottsdale barber shop, and he couldn&#x2019;t help overhearing my announcement to Don that I was finally &#x201c;golfed out&#x201d; and ready to commence work on my next book, one that would be based primarily on material from keynote speeches that I deliver many times each year to corporate and association conventions.<br> &nbsp;<br> In all my writing and speech-making throughout the years. I am forever reminding my audiences that, like the laws of nature, gravity, and physics, the true principles of success have been with us for thousands of years. They have never changed! And these old principles will always work for you&#x2014;or against you&#x2014;no matter how you are trying to live your life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Unfortunately, we&#x2019;re living in an age that often seems to be traveling faster than the speed of light. We&#x2019;re all looking for fast answers to our problems&nbsp;...&nbsp;easy solutions&nbsp;...&nbsp;quick fixes&nbsp;...&nbsp;free lunches&nbsp;...&nbsp;elevators to success&nbsp;...&nbsp;and this futile search for a philosopher&#x2019;s stone that will somehow magically transform our daily efforts into trunks of gold has blinded us to the old laws that have always worked and always will work. Even though they&#x2019;re still right under our noses, we no longer recognize them&nbsp;...&nbsp;and so they have become &#x201c;secrets.&#x201d; How sad.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although I planned, in the new book, to introduce and then explain these ancient principles and how they could be applied by my readers to change their lives, almost immediately, for the better, both my publisher, Bantam Books, and I felt that we should have a different title than &#x201c;The Greatest Secrets of Success,&#x201d; which is how my speech has always been billed and promoted. But what? Several agonizing weeks passed while we tossed ideas around with little progress.<br> &nbsp;<br> For most authors, writing without a title is no big deal. They just forge ahead with their work, confident that sometime before they complete the book, a year or more in the future, either they or their publishers are certain to come up with something provocative enough for that cover page. Not me. I&#x2019;ve always needed a title first&#x2014;a banner around which I could rally my thoughts and feelings constantly, not only when I was at the typewriter but also when I was away from it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Commencing with The Greatest Salesman in the World, in 1967, I&#x2019;ve always known the title of all thirteen of my books before I ever typed the first sentence of Chapter One, and since that procedure has worked well enough to sell more than twenty million volumes, in eighteen languages, I wasn&#x2019;t about to alter my routine in any way. And then, as has happened so many times in my life, fate, chance, luck, coincidence, God (call it what you will) intervened and resolved my problem.<br> &nbsp;<br> After that other barber-shop customer paid for his haircut, he hesitantly approached my chair, where Joan was already doing my nails, and said, &#x201c;Mr. Mandino, I think your books are great. I&#x2019;m a dentist, and I give courses in self-esteem to other members of the dental fraternity, which, for reasons we still don&#x2019;t completely comprehend, has one of the highest suicide rates of any profession in the nation. I use many of your books to reinforce the guidelines on living that I teach.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I mumbled some words of appreciation as he was opening the front door. He paused before stepping outside, turned back, and said, &#x201c;My favorite book of all you have written is The Choice.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I grinned and nodded. &#x201c;There was a lot of me in that one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I rather thought so. Would you be open to a suggestion from this unabashed fan of yours?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You bet!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, in the The Choice, your hero walks away from corporate life and writes a book with a great title that becomes a smash best-seller. I wish you would seriously think about writing a book with that very same title. Perhaps you might even consider it for this new book you were just discussing with Don. Then you could take the rules and suggestions for a more fulfilling existence that your hero wrote and spoke about in that book and combine them with the many other old principles and secrets of success that you have dealt with in all your other works and speeches for so many years. Do that and you most certainly would produce a very special volume that could help millions escape from their prisons of drudgery and unhappiness. Just make it simple and easy for us to use and follow&#x2014;a modern Book of Life, if you will.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As he disappeared into the bright Arizona sunshine, I&#x2019;m certain that I was at least a foot out of the barber&#x2019;s chain. Maybe more. I couldn&#x2019;t wait for Don to finish his cutting and trimming, and I&#x2019;m positive I exceeded a few speed limits racing up Scottsdale Road on my way home to phone my Bantam editor, Michelle Rapkin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Another title?&#x201d; was her greeting.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is it, lady. Now I&#x2019;m ready to go to work!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; she said anxiously.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to borrow the fictitious title given to a fictitious book by a fictitious character created by Og Mandino&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;... who is definitely not fictitious!&#x201d; Michelle exclaimed.<br> &nbsp;<br> I took a deep breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to call the new book A Better Way to Live!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Michelle phoned back late that afternoon. The reaction from Bantam&#x2019;s executives was unanimous approval!<br> &nbsp;<br> That stranger making contact with me in a barber shop and providing me with the title of the book you are now holding&#x2014;fate, coincidence, luck, chance&nbsp;...&nbsp;?<br> &nbsp;<br> Let&#x2019;s take it another step. There are approximately fifty-five thousand new books published each year, and there were probably twenty thou sand different titles, both hardcover and paperback, in the store where this book was purchased. And yet, of all the books you could be reading at this very moment, you are holding A Better Way to Live.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fate, coincidence, luck, chance&nbsp;...&nbsp;? I don&#x2019;t think so. I am convinced that many times, in the course of our lives, God challenges us with a golden opportunity, a seemingly impossible hurdle, or a terrible tragedy&nbsp;...&nbsp;and how we react&#x2014;or fail to react&#x2014;determines the course of our future, almost as if we were involved in some sort of heavenly chess game&nbsp;...&nbsp;with our destiny always in the balance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Is this only a chance meeting between you and me? I don&#x2019;t believe it. As the wise old British poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote a long time ago, &#x201c;Chance is but the pseudonym of God for those particular cases which he does not choose to acknowledge openly with his own sign-manual.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We have been brought together for some special reason, we two. Let&#x2019;s make the most of it.</p><h2>Neither Complementarian nor Egalitarian: A Kingdom Corrective to the Evangelical Gender Debate</h2><p>Regarding gender relations, the evangelical world is divided between complementarians and egalitarians. While both perspectives have much to contribute, the discussion has reached a stalemate. Michelle Lee-Barnewall critiques both sides of the debate, challenging the standard premises and arguments and offering new insight into a perennially divisive issue in the church. She brings fresh biblical exegesis to bear on our cultural situation, presenting an alternative way to move the discussion forward based on a corporate perspective and on kingdom values. The book includes a foreword by Craig&nbsp;L. Blomberg and an afterword by Lynn&nbsp;H. Cohick.</p><p>"Imagine using core biblical themes like corporateness, servant leadership, mutuality, and unity to discuss issues of the relationship of men and women to one another in the church. Imagine focusing not on power or rights but on the example of Christ. If you imagine reframing the gender discussion in helpful ways, then you will be interested in <i>Neither Complementarian nor Egalitarian</i>. When one serves while leading and pays special attention to corporate versus individual themes, things are transformed from the way the world (and sometimes the way the church on both sides of the debate) talks about them. Read this book no matter which side of the debate you are on--and think afresh."<br>--<b>Darrell&nbsp;L. Bock</b>, Dallas Theological Seminary<br><br>"The church's debate over gender and leadership has become an intractable problem because we have adopted the model of the world, where leadership is about equality, rights, privilege, power, and position. Michelle Lee-Barnewall calls for a radical paradigm shift that adopts the upside-down values of the kingdom of God, where humility, love, service, unity, and responsibility replace power, privilege, and position as the guiding principles for true <i>servant </i>leadership. If put into practice, this book would transform not only the gender debate but also the prevailing model for all Christian leadership."<br>--<b>Mark&nbsp;L. Strauss</b>, Bethel Seminary San Diego<br><br>"This well-written book offers a gentle word of correction to sincere Christ followers who are honestly trying to search for biblical truth. It's a perspective-giving message that describes in biblical terms the only way to establish church unity, and it issues a quiet, radical call for pastors and church elders to imitate Christ and the apostles and recall the real cost of discipleship. I highly recommend it as a required textbook for seminary leadership courses."<br>--<b>Sarah Sumner</b>, author of <i>Men and Women in the Church: Building Consensus on Christian Leadership</i><br><br>"In a debate often polarized by shrill rhetoric, Lee-Barnewall rightly urges us instead to take each passage and argument on its own terms and to put kingdom principles first. Regardless of whether one agrees with every detail of Lee-Barnewall's reconstruction, her spirit and larger vision offer a constructive way forward, including a willingness to hear and learn from those with whom we may not agree on every point."<br>--<b>Craig&nbsp;S.

Unable to think clearly or work or even get out of bed, she became anxious and depressed, even suicidal. But rather than let herself sink further, she decided to get better by doing what she does best: she turned her recovery process into a resilience-building game. What started as a simple motivational exercise quickly became a set of rules for &#x201c;post-traumatic growth&#x201d; that she shared on her blog. These rules led to a digital game and a major research study with the National Institutes of Health. Today nearly half a million people have played SuperBetter to get stronger, happier, and healthier.<br><br>But the life-changing ideas behind SuperBetter<i> </i>are much bigger than just one game. In this book, McGonigal reveals a decade&#x2019;s worth of scientific research into the ways all games&#x2014;including videogames, sports, and puzzles&#x2014;change how we respond to stress, challenge, and pain. She explains how we can cultivate new powers of recovery and resilience in everyday life simply by adopting a more &#x201c;gameful&#x201d; mind-set. Being gameful means bringing the same psychological strengths we naturally display when we play games&#x2014;such as optimism, creativity, courage, and determination&#x2014;to real-world goals.<br><p>Drawing on hundreds of studies, McGonigal shows that getting superbetter is as simple as tapping into the three core psychological strengths that games help you build:</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Your ability to control your attention,</b> and therefore your thoughts and feelings <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Your power to turn anyone into a potential ally,</b> and to strengthen your existing relationships <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;<b>Your natural capacity to motivate yourself and super-charge your heroic qualities,</b> like willpower, compassion, and determination <br><br><p><i>SuperBetter</i> contains nearly 100 playful challenges anyone can undertake in order to build these gameful strengths. It includes stories and data from people who have used the SuperBetter method to get stronger in the face of illness, injury, and other major setbacks, as well as to achieve goals like losing weight, running a marathon, and finding a new job.<br><br>As inspiring as it is down to earth, and grounded in rigorous research, <i>SuperBetter</i> is a proven game plan for a better life. You&#x2019;ll never say that something is &#x201c;just a game&#x201d; again.</p></p><p><b>Jane McGonigal, PhD,</b> is a senior researcher at the Institute for the Future and the author of&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;<i>Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World</i>.

She has been called one of the top ten innovators to watch (<i>BusinessWeek</i>), one of the one hundred most creative people in business (<i>Fast Company</i>), and one of the fifty most important people in the gaming industry (<i>Game Developers Magazine</i>). Her TED talks on games have been viewed more than ten million times.<p></p><p>Before You Play, Here&#x2019;s What You Need to Know</p><p>The SuperBetter method is designed to make you stronger, happier, braver, and more resilient.</p><p>It&#x2019;s based on the science of games&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s <i>a lot</i> of evidence that it works.</p><p>A<b> randomized, controlled study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania</b> found that playing SuperBetter for thirty days significantly reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety and increases optimism, social support, and players&#x2019; belief in their own ability to succeed and achieve their goals. The study also found that people who followed the SuperBetter rules for one month were significantly happier and more satisfied with their lives.</p><p>A <b>clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health</b> and conducted at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and Cincinnati Children&#x2019;s Hospital found that the SuperBetter method improves mood, decreases anxiety and suffering, and strengthens family relationships during rehabilitation and recovery.</p><p>Meanwhile, <b>data collected from more than 400,000 SuperBetter players</b> has helped me improve the method, to make it easier to learn and more fun to use in everyday life.</p><p>Every single day for the past five years I&#x2019;ve heard from someone who says that the SuperBetter method has changed their life. It is my greatest hope that SuperBetter will help<i> you</i> tackle your toughest challenges, and pursue your biggest dreams, with more courage, creativity, optimism, and support.</p><p>Please remember, the SuperBetter method is <i>not</i> a substitute for medical advice or treatment. Many successful SuperBetter players&#x2014;including a majority of participants in the University of Pennsylvania study and all the participants in the clinical trial&#x2014;followed the SuperBetter method alongside some form of continuing counseling, medication, or rehabilitation, or with a doctor&#x2019;s supervision.<i> The SuperBetter method is NOT an alternative to therapy, counseling, ongoing medical treatment, or medication&#x2014;nor is any game recommended or discussed in this book.</i></p><p>Now that you know&#x2014;let&#x2019;s play!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>You are stronger than you know.</p><p>You are surrounded by potential allies.</p><p>You are the hero of your own story.</p><p>These three qualities are all it takes to become happier, braver, and more resilient in the face of any challenge.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the good news: You already have these qualities within you. You don&#x2019;t have to change a thing. You are <i>already</i> more powerful than you realize.</p><p>You have the ability to control your attention&#x2014;and therefore your thoughts and feelings.</p><p>You have the strength to find support in the most unexpected places, and deepen your existing relationships.</p><p>You have a natural capacity to motivate yourself and supercharge your heroic qualities, like willpower, compassion, and determination.</p><p>This book will help you understand the powers you already have&#x2014;and show you that accessing these powers is <i>as easy as playing a game</i>.</p><p>And yet this book is not about playing games&#x2014;at least, not exactly. It&#x2019;s about learning <i>how to be</i> <i>gameful</i> in the face of extreme stress and personal challenge.</p><p>Being gameful means bringing the psychological strengths you naturally display when you play games&#x2014;such as optimism, creativity, courage, and determination&#x2014;to your real life. It means having the curiosity and openness to play with different strategies to discover what works best. It means building up the resilience to tackle tougher and tougher challenges with greater and greater success.</p><p>The best way I know to explain what it means to be gameful&#x2014;and how being gameful can make you stronger, happier, and braver&#x2014;is to tell you a story. It&#x2019;s the story of how I invented the SuperBetter method&#x2014;and the life-threatening challenge I had to overcome to be able to write this book.</p><p>In the summer of 2009, I hit my head and got a concussion. It didn&#x2019;t heal properly, and after thirty days I still had constant headaches, nausea, and vertigo. I couldn&#x2019;t read or write for more than a few minutes at a time. I had trouble remembering things. Most days I felt too sick to get out of bed. I was in a total mental fog. These symptoms left me more anxious and depressed than I had ever been in my life.</p><p>I had trouble communicating clearly to friends and family exactly what I was going through. I thought if I could write something down, it would help. I struggled and struggled to put together words that made sense, and this is what I came up with:</p><p>Everything is hard.</p><p>The iron fist is pushing against my thoughts.</p><p>My whole brain feels vacuum pressurized.</p><p>If I can&#x2019;t think who am I?</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no real treatment for postconcussion syndrome. You just rest as much as you can and hope for the best. I was told I might not feel better for months or even a year or longer.</p><p>There was one thing I could do to try to heal faster. My doctor told me I should avoid everything that triggered my symptoms. That meant no reading, no writing, no running, no video games, no work, no email, no alcohol, and no caffeine. I joked to my doctor at the time: &#x201c;In other words, no reason to live.&#x201d;</p><p>There was quite a bit of truth in that joke. I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but suicidal ideation is very common with traumatic brain injuries&#x2014;even mild ones like mine.1 It happens to one in three, and it happened to me. My brain started telling me: <i>Jane, you want to die.</i> It said, <i>You&#x2019;re never going to get better. The pain will never end. You&#x2019;ll be a burden to your husband.</i></p><p>These voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimately fear for my life.</p><p>And then something happened. I had one crystal-clear thought that changed everything. Thirty-four days after I hit my head&#x2014;and I will never forget this moment&#x2014;I said to myself, <i>I am either going to kill myself, or I&#x2019;m going to turn this into a game.</i></p><p>Why a game? By the time I hit my head in 2009, I&#x2019;d been researching the psychology of games for nearly a decade. In fact, I was the first person in the world to earn a Ph.D. studying the psychological strengths of gamers and how those strengths can translate to real-world problem solving. I knew from my years of research at the University of California at Berkeley that when we play a game, we tackle tough challenges with more creativity, more determination, and more optimism. We&#x2019;re also more likely to reach out to others for help. And I wanted to bring these gameful traits to my real-life challenge.</p><p>So I created a simple recovery game called &#x201c;Jane the Concussion Slayer.&#x201d; This became my new <i>secret identity</i>, a way to start feeling heroic and determined instead of hopeless.</p><p>The first thing I did as the concussion slayer was to call my twin sister, Kelly, and tell her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m playing a game to heal my brain, and I want you to play with me.&#x201d; This was an easy way to ask for help. She became my first <i>ally</i> in the game. My husband, Kiyash, joined next.</p><p>Together we identified and battled the <i>bad guys. </i>These were anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process&#x2014;things like bright lights and crowded spaces.</p><p>We also collected and activated <i>power-ups. </i>These were anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good or happy or powerful. Some of my favorite power-ups were cuddling my Shetland sheepdog for five minutes, eating walnuts (good for my brain), and walking around the block twice with my husband.</p><p>The game was that simple: adopt a secret identity, recruit allies, battle the bad guys, and activate power-ups. But even with a game so simple, within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away. It just vanished. It felt like a miracle to me. It <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms&#x2014;they lasted more than a year, and it was the hardest year of my life by far. But even when I still had the symptoms, even while I was still in pain, <i>I stopped suffering</i>. I felt more in control of my own destiny. My friends and family knew exactly how to help and support me. And I started to see myself as a much stronger person.</p><p>What happened next with the game surprised me. After a few months, I put up a blog post and a short video online explaining how to play. Not everybody has a concussion, and not everyone wants to be &#x201c;the slayer,&#x201d; so I renamed the game <i>SuperBetter</i>.</p><p>Why SuperBetter? Everyone had told me to &#x201c;get better soon&#x201d; while I was recovering from the concussion, but I didn&#x2019;t want just to get better, as in back to normal. I wanted to get <i>super</i>better: happier and healthier than I&#x2019;d been before the injury.</p><p>Soon I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identities, recruiting their own allies, and fighting their own bad guys. They were getting &#x201c;superbetter&#x201d; at facing challenges like depression and anxiety, surgery and chronic pain, migraines and Crohn&#x2019;s disease, healing a broken heart and finding a job after years of unemployment. People were even playing it for extremely serious, even terminal diagnoses, like stage-five cancer and Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s disease (ALS). And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me.</p><p>These players talked about feeling stronger and braver. They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family. And they talked about feeling happier, even though they were in pain, even though they were tackling the toughest challenges of their lives.</p><p>At the time, I thought to myself, <i>What on earth is going on here?</i> How could a game so seemingly trivial, so admittedly simple, intervene so powerfully in such serious, in some cases life-and-death, circumstances? To be frank, if it hadn&#x2019;t already worked for me, there&#x2019;s no way I would have believed it was possible.</p><p>When I was recovered enough to do research, I dove into the scientific literature. And here&#x2019;s what I learned: some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event. And that&#x2019;s what was happening to us. The game was helping us experience what scientists call <i>post-traumatic growth, </i>which is not something we usually hear about. More commonly, we hear about <i>post-traumatic stress disorder</i>, in which individuals experience ongoing anxiety and depression.</p><p>But research has shown that traumatic events don&#x2019;t always lead to long-term difficulty. Instead, some individuals find that struggling with highly challenging life circumstances helps them unleash their best qualities and eventually lead happier lives.2</p><p>To give you a better idea of what post-traumatic growth looks like, here are the top five things that people with post-traumatic growth say:</p><p>1. My priorities have changed. I&#x2019;m not afraid to do what makes me happy.</p><p>2. I feel closer to my friends and family.</p><p>3. I understand myself better. I know who I really am now.</p><p>4. I have a new sense of meaning and purpose in my life.</p><p>5. I&#x2019;m better able to focus on my goals and dreams.3</p><p>Taken together, these five traits represent a powerful positive transformation. But it&#x2019;s more than that. There&#x2019;s actually something quite astonishing about the benefits of post-traumatic growth, something I noticed in the course of my research.</p><p>A few years ago an Australian hospice worker named Bronnie Ware published an article called &#x201c;Regrets of the Dying.&#x201d;4 Ware would know&#x2014;she had spent a decade caring for patients at the end of their lives. She wrote that the same regrets were repeated again and again by her patients, year after year&#x2014;and after she published her article, she heard from hundreds of hospice workers and caretakers all over the world who confirmed her findings. They had heard the same five regrets over the years. Apparently they are nearly universal. Not everyone has regrets on their deathbed&#x2014;but if they do, they are likely to be one or more of the following:</p><p>1. I wish I hadn&#x2019;t worked so hard.</p><p>2. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.</p><p>3. I wish I had let myself be happier.</p><p>4. I wish I&#x2019;d had the courage to express my true self.</p><p>5. I wish I&#x2019;d lived a life true to my dreams, instead of what others expected of me.</p><p>Think about this list for a moment. Are you having the same &#x201c;aha!&#x201d; moment that I had, two years ago, when I first encountered it?</p><p>Remarkably, the top five regrets of the dying are essentially the <i>exact opposite</i> of the top five experiences of post-traumatic growth. With post-traumatic growth, we find the strength and courage to do the things that make us happy, and to understand and express our true selves. We prioritize relationships and meaningful work that inspires us.</p><p>Post-traumatic growth is not the opposite of post-traumatic stress disorder, by the way. Many people who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder <i>also </i>go on to experience post-traumatic growth. The two are not mutually exclusive by any means. In fact, one study found that symptoms of post-traumatic stress were actually predictive of eventual post-traumatic growth&#x2014;possibly because transformative growth requires wrestling in a deep and sustained way with something very difficult. If we bounce back too quickly, we miss the growth.5</p><p>Extreme personal challenge&#x2014;if we respond in the right way&#x2014;unlocks our ability to lead a life truer to our dreams and free of regrets. Looked at this way, post-traumatic growth&#x2014;or getting superbetter&#x2014;seems like a pretty strong candidate for the single most desirable personal transformation anyone could hope to undertake.</p><p>But how do you get from extreme stress or trauma to these five benefits? Research shows that not everyone who experiences a trauma goes on to have post-traumatic growth. So what exactly is the right process?</p><p>More important, is there any way to experience these benefits <i>without having a trauma</i>? I&#x2019;m pretty sure no one would ever choose to suffer a terrible loss, an injury, an illness, or any other kind of trauma just to get these benefits. But at the same time, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to lead a life truer to their dreams and free of regret?</p><p>And so I set off on another two years of research. And here&#x2019;s what I discovered: you <i>can </i>experience the benefits of post-traumatic growth without the trauma, if you are willing to undertake an extreme challenge in your life&#x2014;such as running a marathon, writing a book, starting a business, becoming a parent, quitting smoking, or making a spiritual journey. Researchers call this <i>post-ecstatic growth. </i>Ann Marie Roepke, a practicing clinical psychologist who first identified the phenomenon as a University of Pennsylvania doctoral candidate, describes it as &#x201c;gains without pains&#x201d;&#x2014;or at least, far fewer pains.6 It works the same way post-traumatic growth does, except you get to choose your own challenge. Instead of waiting for life to throw a terrible trauma at you, you can cultivate post-ecstatic growth at any time by intentionally undertaking a meaningful project or mission that creates significant stress and challenge for you. This stressful adventure you&#x2019;ve chosen for yourself creates the necessary conditions for you...</p></p><h2>Live a Praying Life: Open Your Life to God&#39;s Power and Provision</h2><p>This revised, 13-week study goes back to the biblical basics of prayer, cleaning out myths about prayer to rev up a powerful, ongoing connection to God that can invigorate every aspect of a Christian&#x2019;s life.

Sharing a summer house with a hot-as-hell roommate should be a dream come true, right? Not when it&#x2019;s Justin...the only person I&#x2019;d ever loved...who now hates me. When my grandmother died and left me half of the house on Aquidneck Island, there was a catch: the other half would go to the boy she helped raise.

I hadn&#x2019;t seen him in years, and now we&#x2019;re living together because neither one of us is willing to give up the house. The worst part? He didn&#x2019;t come alone. I&#x2019;d soon realize there&#x2019;s a thin line between love and hate. I could see through that smug smile. Beneath it all...the boy is still there. So is our connection.

(What Was?)</h2><p>Before 1914, traveling from the East Coast to the West Coast meant going by land across the entire United States. To go by sea involved a long journey around South America and north along the Pacific Coast. But then, in a dangerous and amazing feat of engineering, a 48-mile-long channel was dug through Panama, creating the world&#x2019;s most famous shortcut: the Panama Canal!</p><p>Janet Pascal is an Executive Production Editor at Viking Children's Books and the author of <i>Who Was Dr. Seuss?,&nbsp;Who Was Maurice Sendak?</i>,&nbsp;and <i>Who Was Abraham Lincoln? </i>She lives in New York City.<b>What Is the Panama Canal?</b><p>&#x201c;I would never . . . navigate . . . round that wretched place again. It is the kingdom of Satan,&#x201d; said a sailor in the nineteenth century. He was speaking of the trip around Cape Horn between South America and Antarctica. &#x201c;Rounding the Horn,&#x201d; as sailors call it, is one of the wildest, most dangerous trips a ship can make. For as many as two hundred days a year, gale-force winds blow there with gusts ranging from fifty to eighty miles per hour. The waves can reach ninety feet high or more.</p><p>Yet for hundreds of years, if anyone wanted to sail west from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, they had no choice. They had to round the Horn. Surviving the trip became the sign of a truly brave seaman. After a sailor had managed to sail around the Horn three times, he could wear a silver earring, as a badge of honor. Many did not make it. No one knows for sure, but there may be one thousand shipwrecks lying under the water, and as many as fifteen thousand drowned sailors.</p><p>People dreamed of an easier way to sail from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. On maps, one place looked very promising. This was the Isthmus of Panama. An isthmus is a narrow strip connecting two pieces of land. The Isthmus of Panama joins Central America to South America. On one side is the Caribbean Sea, which runs into the Atlantic Ocean. On the other, the Gulf of Panama flows into the Pacific. At its narrowest, the isthmus is only thirty miles wide. The Atlantic and the Pacific looked so close together there! Surely some way could be found to cut across. Then ships would be able to sail right through Panama. The trip would become thousands of miles shorter, and no one would have to risk their lives sailing around Cape Horn.</p></p><h2>Gung Ho! : Turn on the People in Any Organization</h2><p>With a new foreword by Ken Blanchard An invaluable new strategy for creating enthusiastic employees, from the author of the bestselling The One Minute Manager.

But few people know that when it came to the behavior of individuals&#x2014;the way we perceive ourselves, the way we treat others, and the decisions we make in pursuit of happiness&#x2014;the Scottish philosopher had just as much to say. He developed his ideas on human nature in an epic, sprawling work titled<i>&nbsp;The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>.<br><br>Most economists have never read it, and for most of his life, Russ Roberts was no exception. But when he finally picked up the book by the founder of his field, he realized he&#x2019;d stumbled upon what might be the greatest self-help book that almost no one has read.<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life</i>, Roberts examines Smith&#x2019;s forgotten masterpiece, and finds a treasure trove of timeless, practical wisdom. Smith&#x2019;s insights into human nature are just as relevant today as they were three hundred years ago. What does it take to be truly happy? Should we pursue fame and fortune or the respect of our friends and family? How can we make the world a better place?

Religion, philosophy, and modern self-help books grapple with the question, but the answer is elusive. Does it mean being happy? Or is it about wealth and professional success? What role does virtue play? Does the good life mean being good? Does it mean helping others and making the world a better place?</p><p>Two hundred and fifty years ago, a Scottish moral philosopher addressed these questions in a book with the unglamorous title <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>. The book was Adam Smith&#x2019;s attempt to explain where morality comes from and why people can act with decency and virtue even when it conflicts with their own self-interest. It&#x2019;s a mix of psychology, philosophy, and what we now call behavioral economics, peppered with Smith&#x2019;s observations on friendship, the pursuit of wealth, the pursuit of happiness, and virtue. Along the way, Smith tells his readers what the good life is and how to achieve it.</p><p>The book was a success in its day. But today <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> is virtually forgotten, dwarfed by the reputation Smith achieved with his second book. That book, <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>, published in 1776, made Adam Smith forever famous and gave birth to the field of economics. While few people still read <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, it&#x2019;s undeniably a famous book, a classic. Fewer still read or have even heard of Smith&#x2019;s other book, <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>.</p><p>For most of my career, I hadn&#x2019;t read it either. That&#x2019;s a bit awkward for an economist to confess. You&#x2019;d think I would have read both major books by the founder of my field. But until recently, I knew very little about <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>. In fact, for most of my career, I never heard anyone mention Smith&#x2019;s other book, the not-famous one, the weird one with the daunting title that didn&#x2019;t sound like it had much to do with economics.</p><p>My relationship to <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments </i>changed when my friend Dan Klein at George Mason University suggested that I interview him about it on my weekly podcast, <i>EconTalk.</i> I agreed, thinking it would get me to finally read the book. I did at least own a copy&#x2014;I had bought it maybe thirty years earlier, thinking that an economist should at least <i>own</i> both of Adam Smith&#x2019;s books. I took it down off my shelf, opened the book to the first page, and began reading.</p><p>How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.</p><p>Forty-two words. A long sentence by modern standards. I had to read Smith&#x2019;s opening sentence twice before I understood what he was saying: that even though people can be pretty selfish, they do care about other people&#x2019;s happiness. Makes sense. I kept reading. I read the first page. Then the second page and the third. I closed the book. A second confession&#x2014;I had no idea what Smith was talking about. The book appeared to begin in midstream. Unlike <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, which is delightful and engaging prose from the get-go, <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> is very slow going. I had a moment of unease&#x2014;maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t have agreed to the interview. I wasn&#x2019;t sure I could figure out what this book was about. I was going to embarrass myself. I thought of asking Dan to cancel.</p><p>I pressed on, hoping to find my footing. I started over. Eventually I began to get a feel for what Smith was up to. A third of the way in, I was hooked. I lugged it to my daughter&#x2019;s soccer games and devoured it at halftime and when my daughter wasn&#x2019;t playing. I started reading excerpts out loud to my wife and kids at the dinner table, hoping to get them interested in Smith&#x2019;s ideas about how to relate to others. The margins of the book began to fill up with stars and exclamation points marking passages I had enjoyed. By the time I finished the book, I wanted to shout from the rooftops&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a marvel, a hidden gem, you&#x2019;ve got to read it!</p><p>The book changed the way I looked at people, and maybe more important, it changed the way I looked at myself. Smith made me aware of how people interact with each other in ways I hadn&#x2019;t noticed before. He dispenses timeless advice about how to treat money, ambition, fame, and morality. He tells the reader how to find happiness, how to treat material success and failure. He also describes the path to virtue and goodness and why it&#x2019;s a path worth pursuing.</p><p>Smith helped me understand why Whitney Houston and Marilyn Monroe were so unhappy and why their deaths made so many people so sad. He helped me understand my affection for my iPad and my iPhone, why talking to strangers about your troubles can calm the soul, and why people can think monstrous thoughts but rarely act upon them. He helped me understand why people adore politicians and how morality is built into the fabric of the world.</p><p>And even though he&#x2019;s the father of capitalism and wrote the most famous and maybe the best book ever on why some nations are rich and others are poor, Adam Smith in <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> wrote as eloquently as anyone ever has on the futility of pursuing money with the hope of finding happiness. How do you reconcile that with the fact that no one did more than Adam Smith to make capitalism and self-interest respectable? That is a puzzle I try to unravel toward the end of this book.</p><p>Besides the emptiness of excessive materialism, Smith understood the potential we have for self-deception, the danger of unintended consequences, the seductive lure of fame and power, the limitations of human reason, and the unseen sources of what makes our lives both so complex and yet at times so orderly. <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> is a book of observations about what makes us tick. As a bonus, almost in passing, Smith tells us how to lead the good life in the fullest sense of that phrase.</p><p>The details of Smith&#x2019;s own life are fairly mundane. He was born in the village of Kircaldy, Scotland, in 1723. His father died a few months later. At the age of fourteen, Smith went off to school at the University of Glasgow, then Oxford, returning to lecture at the University of Edinburgh before being appointed at the University of Glasgow in 1751, as a professor first of logic and then of moral philosophy. His mother and unmarried aunt joined him in Glasgow at the house provided by the university. In 1763 he left academic life for a more lucrative job tutoring the wealthy young Duke of Buccleuch.</p><p>This must have been a rather dramatic change of pace for the forty-year-old Smith, giving him an intimate look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous of his day. For two and a half years, Smith traveled in France and Switzerland with the boy and, along the way, met some of the great European intellectuals of the time, including Voltaire, Fran�ois Quesnay, and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot. After returning from Europe, he spent the next decade in Kircaldy and then London, working on <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>.</p><p>In 1778, Smith moved from London to Edinburgh to live with his mother and several cousins. That same year he was appointed one of the five commissioners of customs in Scotland, leading a bureaucracy that sought out contraband and collected duties, or what we now call tariffs. Perhaps the most influential defender of free trade in the history of political economy spent the last years of his life reducing the flow of smuggled goods and collecting taxes for the government from importers.</p><p>Other than his time in Europe, Smith appears to have led what most would call a particularly unexciting life. He was a lecturer, a professor, a tutor&#x2014;three jobs that are renowned for being removed from what might be called reality. Joseph Schumpeter wrote, &#x201c;No woman, excepting his mother, ever played a role in his existence: in this as in other respects the glamours and passions of life were just literature to him.&#x201d; Schumpeter exaggerated a bit, but Smith never married. He died in 1790 at the age of sixty-seven.</p><p>Such was Smith&#x2019;s outer life. What about his inner life? No journal or diary survived Smith&#x2019;s death&#x2014;he asked that all his private papers be destroyed. With a few exceptions, most of his letters are spare and businesslike, even when he is writing his best friend, the great philosopher and his fellow countryman David Hume. How could a man of Smith&#x2019;s seemingly limited experience plumb the depths of human interaction and manage to dredge up any insight?</p><p>We know he managed to do so because we have <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>. First published in 1759, the book went through six editions, the last one published in 1790, the year of Smith&#x2019;s death, when he made substantial revisions to the text. In a sense, <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> was Smith&#x2019;s first and last book.</p><p>I think I know why he revised it late in his life, at a time when he was doing little serious scholarship that has survived. Once you start to think about human motivation and the bright and dark side of humanity&#x2014;what Faulkner called the &#x201c;human heart in conflict with itself&#x201d;&#x2014;it&#x2019;s hard to think about anything else. Trying to understand your neighbor and, in turn, yourself really doesn&#x2019;t get old. There&#x2019;s a brand-new set of data every day to chew on and explore if you&#x2019;re interested&#x2014;all those interactions with friends, family, colleagues, and strangers.</p><p>Reading <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>, you realize that morality and the meaning of life and how people behave haven&#x2019;t changed much since the eighteenth century. A wise-enough man can reach across more than two centuries, get your attention, and teach you a thing or two about yourself and what&#x2019;s important.</p><p>Adding to the delight is that Smith can really write. He&#x2019;s ironic, funny, and eloquent. When he hits his stride and warns you about getting too involved with fancy gadgets that fit in your pocket, you feel like you&#x2019;ve found a secret source of wisdom. It&#x2019;s like discovering that Bruce Wayne, that successful man about town, has even more to share with the world and that his hidden side may be a lot more interesting than his public persona.</p><p>So why is <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> such a secret? Smith&#x2019;s road map to happiness, goodness, and self-knowledge is an old road map. The language is a little bit dusty, betraying its eighteenth-century origin. More than that, it&#x2019;s a road map that takes a lot of difficult twists and turns. The book occasionally doubles back on itself, and you find yourself in a spot you feel you&#x2019;ve visited before. It isn&#x2019;t the easiest going for the modern reader.</p><p>Smith was writing an academic treatise, in intellectual competition with other authors with their own theories of human motivation. Most of those authors&#x2014;writers like Bernard Mandeville and Francis Hutcheson and the Stoics&#x2014;are long forgotten by most of us, along with their particular visions of humanity. Smith spends a decent amount of space explaining why his theories and insights are preferable to the competition&#x2019;s. So it doesn&#x2019;t read much like a self-help book.</p><p>It would make me very happy if more people read <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>. There&#x2019;s a wonderful edition still in print that is reasonably priced, and you can read it without charge at EconLib.org. Much of the charm of <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> is in the poetry of Smith&#x2019;s language. He was a great stylist, and that explains part of his success. But we twenty-first-century folk can find old prose daunting&#x2014;the sentences are often long, and they&#x2019;re structured in ways our brains don&#x2019;t process well without some practice. They take a lot of time and patience. But if you&#x2019;re a little busy, part of my aim here is to give you Smith&#x2019;s insights and some of the best of his writing, just in case you don&#x2019;t get around to reading all of the original.</p><p>My other mission is to bring Smith&#x2019;s ideas into the present and see how they might be useful to you and me. We all see ourselves as special&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m sure you are&#x2014;but we also have much in common. We have many of the same strengths and weaknesses. So when Smith teaches me something about myself, he often teaches me something about you. And that helps me treat you the way you&#x2019;d like to be treated and gives you an idea of how to treat me. More than that, Smith was trying to understand what makes us happy and what gives life meaning. These are still pretty useful things to understand.</p><p>I struggled with how to get Smith&#x2019;s lessons into digestible form. The normal strategy would be to follow Smith&#x2019;s narrative in his book. But it&#x2019;s not a linear narrative, and many of his concerns and topics are not of interest to the modern reader. So I&#x2019;ve taken Smith&#x2019;s most relevant insights and organized them into an order that I think is more accessible than the original. I also quote Smith directly whenever I can&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve managed to squeeze in most of my favorite quotes from <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>. But where necessary I&#x2019;ve broken them up and offered running commentary explaining the allusions and stylistic peculiarities of a well-educated gentleman of 1759. Unless I note otherwise, all quotes are from <i>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</i>. Within those quotes, I will occasionally use brackets [like this] to explain an archaic word or phrase. I&#x2019;ve left Smith&#x2019;s spelling as he wrote it. So &#x201c;labor&#x201d; becomes &#x201c;labour,&#x201d; &#x201c;honor&#x201d; becomes &#x201c;honour,&#x201d; and &#x201c;befall&#x201d; has only one &#x201c;l.&#x201d;</p><p>You might be wondering what an eighteenth-century book on morality and human nature has to do with economics, Smith&#x2019;s most famous legacy. Behavioral economists today do their work at the border between economics and psychology, which is very Smithian territory. But most economists in the twenty-first century try to predict interest rates, suggest policies to reduce unemployment and soften its sting, or forecast the next quarter&#x2019;s GDP. Sometimes they try to explain why the stock market went up or down. They&#x2019;re not particularly good at any of these things, and they often disagree on the best policies for getting the economy going. This leads noneconomists to conclude that economics is mostly about money and that economists are not very reliable predictors of the future or the best engineers to be steering the economic engine.</p><p>Unfortunately, what the media and the public expect from economists is what we are probably worst at&#x2014;giving precise answers to questions that presume the economy is like some giant clock or machine whose innards can be mastered and then manipulated with some degree of precision. The failure of my profession to anticipate the Great Recession, to agree on how to get out of it, or to predict the path of the recovery should humble all economists.</p><p>But economics is actually quite useful&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just not so useful for the things people typically expect from it. When I tell people I&#x2019;m an economist, they often respond by saying something like &#x201c;That must be useful around tax time,&#x201d; or &#x201c;You must know a lot about the stock market.&#x201d; Alas, I am not an accountant or a stockbroker, I explain. But one very useful thing I&#x2019;ve learned...</p></p><h2>That Is Not a Good Idea!</h2><p><p><em>That Is Not a Good Idea!</em> is a hilarious, interactive picture book from bestselling author and illustrator Mo Willems, the creator of books like <em>Don&#x2019;t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus</em>, the Knuffle Bunny series, the Elephant and Piggie series, <em>Goldilocks and the Three Dinosaurs</em>, and many other new classics.<br>&nbsp;<br>Inspired by the evil villains and innocent damsels of silent movies, Willems tells the tale of a hungry fox who invites a plump goose to dinner.

And with each book, I go through hundreds of sketches that aren&#x2019;t used. Here are a few that I did in the early stages of <i>That Is Not a Good Idea!</i> for Hungry Fox, Plump Goose, and the Baby Geese. <p></p> Purple Fox: After I have a sense of a story and their characters, I start to make test sketches. It's my hope that the technique (the brushes, pencils, markers, or crayons) will give me an insight into who the characters really are. <p></p> Baby Geese: This process goes on for a while (sometimes weeks, sometimes months). Even the character stylings that don't work help. The covering-the-eye pose from this test was used in the final book, even though the characters look completely different. <p></p> Goodwolf Sketch: We use butcher-paper as our tablecloth, so that our family can doodle every night after dinner. (You can see some examples on the Mo Willems Doodles blog.) All of the characters seem to have taken over this night's dinner (I saved the drawing for later reference). Test Background: Once the characters started to come into focus, it was time to go through the same process with the backgrounds...<p>One day, a very hungry fox meets a very plump goose. </p><p>A dinner invitation is offered. </p><p>Will dinner go as planned? Or do the dinner plans involve a secret ingredient . . . ? </p><p>(Don't forget to listen to the baby geese!)</p><p>From the brilliant mind of Mo Willems comes a surprising lesson about listening to your inner gosling. </p></p><h2>Anger Is a Gift: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>The trade paperback edition of the highly buzzed about YA debut from Mark Oshiro, <i>Anger Is a Gift</i> follows a boy from Oakland as he falls in love amidst the chaos of modern America.</b></p><p><b>*31st Annual Lammy Finalist for</b> <b>LGBTQ Children</b><b>&#x2019;</b><b>s/Young Adult</b><b> category*</b><br><b>*2019 ALA </b><b>Schneider Family Book Award Teen Winner*</b><b></b><br><b>*<i>Buzzfeed</i>'s 24 Best YA Books of 2018*</b><br><b>*<i>Vulture</i>'s 38 Best LGBTQ YA Novels*</b><b></b><br><b>*<i>Book Riot</i>'s Best Books 2018*</b><br><b>*<i>Hyable</i>'s Most Anticipated Queer YA Books of 2018*</b><br><b>*<i>The Mary Sue</i>'s 18 Books You Should Read in 2018*</b></p><p>Moss Jeffries is many things&#x2015;considerate student, devoted son, loyal friend and affectionate boyfriend, enthusiastic nerd. </p><p>But sometimes Moss still wishes he could be someone else&#x2015;someone without panic attacks, someone whose father was still alive, someone who hadn&#x2019;t become a rallying point for a community because of one horrible night.</p><p>And most of all, he wishes he didn&#x2019;t feel so stuck.</p><p>Moss can&#x2019;t even escape at school&#x2015;he and his friends are subject to the lack of funds and crumbling infrastructure at West Oakland High, as well as constant intimidation by the resource officer stationed in their halls.

The nearest town was six miles away, so my&nbsp;childhood was spent in the countryside. I learned to bake from a young age,&nbsp;and as a teenager I worked in a konditori (bakery) in that nearby small town.&nbsp;From the age of thirteen, children in Sweden can take two weeks every semester&nbsp;to do practical training at a local workplace, which is how I came to be at the&nbsp;Holgers Konditori. Opened in 1903, the bakery is located in the main square&nbsp;and is where everyone in town goes for special-occasion&nbsp;cakes, cookies, and&nbsp;buns. When I finished my training, Holgers offered me a summer job, and&nbsp;I worked there every summer. I loved every minute.<br><br>That love of baking extended into my home life, particularly around the holidays.&nbsp;Once autumn arrived, which brought fewer daylight hours, inside activities like&nbsp;baking became the norm. Come winter, nighttime fell early, and any opportunity&nbsp;to celebrate and decorate&#x2014;especially&nbsp;with lights&#x2014;helped&nbsp;brighten the darkest&nbsp;time of year. In Sweden, holiday celebrations start early and include many&nbsp;festivities, such as the Advent season, which begins on the fourth Sunday&nbsp;preceding Christmas. One of my favorite celebrations is St. Lucia Day, in which&nbsp;girls dressed in white lead a candlelight procession, and everyone in the group&nbsp;sings and pepparkakor, a gingery cookie with plenty of snap (you&#x2019;ll find the&nbsp;recipe on page 88), is served. A lot of baking is done early in December, when&nbsp;breads, cakes, cookies, and confections are made and then stored for the&nbsp;upcoming celebrations. I remember eating many of these treats only during&nbsp;the holidays, so just making them would put you in the spirit of the season.</p><h2>The Autobiography of Mr. Spock: The Life of a Federation Legend</h2><p><b><b>Fictional autobiography of the iconic Star Trek character, told in his own words and telling the story of his life, including his difficult childhood, his adventures on the Enterprise, and his death and resurrection on the Genesis Planet.</b></b><br><br>"The Autobiography of Mr. Spock" tells the story of one of Starfleet's finest officers, and one the Federations most celebrated citizens.

With a balance of styles, sensibilities, and palettes, the work showcases seven unique approaches to the central theme of finding a hidden door. Most of the entries hinge on a kid facing an emotional or physical peril. In "Asteria Crane," Kibuishi delivers a cinematic tale of experimental dream therapy that could easily be at home as a sci-fi film. In "Luis 2.0," Jen Wang shares a sweet vignette about wanting to become someone else, only to find it's better being one's authentic self after all. The range in this slim volume is expansive. From funny to deep and fantastical to refined, all of the stories have a compelling narrative arc. The colors are just as varied, and are universally dynamic and nuanced. Consider this (and previous series installments) as a necessary addition to any graphic novel collection.&#x2014;Jenna Lanterman, formerly at The Calhoun School and Mary McDowell Friends School, New York City</p><h2>Why Men Hate Going to Church</h2><p><p><strong>Christianity is the only world religion with a chronic shortage of men.

Now, here at last, is the rest of his extraordinary life story&#x2015;and what happened behind the camera is even more remarkable than what you saw on the big screen. In this soul-searching autobiography, Warren revealed the secrets of his past and the peaks and valleys he navigated in bringing the sport he loves to audiences worldwide. Freedom Found is a must-read for Warren&#x2019;s legion of fans, ski history enthusiasts, adrenaline junkies and anyone whose interest is piqued by an extraordinary 20th-century success story. This is a heartwarming and at times heart-wrenching account of an American innovator who did it his own way, understood the importance of making people laugh, and never looked back.</p><p>Warren Miller (October 15, 1924-January 24, 2018) was born in Hollywood in 1924. His Depression-era childhood in a dysfunctional home motivated him to find his own freedom in the outdoors, leading to a lifelong obsession with snow, surf and adventure. He premiered his first annual ski film in 1950, and over the next five-plus decades millions of skiers and snowboarders flocked to his films, worshiping his unique sense of humor, candor and adventure. His company produced more than 500 films in all, and Warren also wrote eight books. Warren was inducted into the U.S. Ski Hall of Fame in 1978, and lived in Big Sky, Montana, and Orcas Island, Washington, with his wife, Laurie. He died at age 93 in 2018.<br><br>Andy Bigford has spent 30-plus years in the publishing and media business.

Based on the attractions from the Disney Parks, each new book tells the story of one of the Haunted Mansion's 999 ghosts. With eerie illustrations throughout and a beautiful three-piece cloth cover, the books are designed to look like they came straight from the library in the Haunted Mansion. <br><i>Tales from the Haunted Mansion</i> is a fun, spooky ride, just like the attraction from the Disney Parks. And if readers are familiar with the ride, they'll see elements of it throughout the entire story, from items straight of the Mansion (are those pictures stretching?) to lyrics from the narration that is heard in each Doom Buggy.<br>In this bone-chilling book, you will hear the terrifying tales of the Fearsome Foursome--four kids who look to out-scare each other. But just wait until they hear my spooky stories. Who am I? I am Amicus Arcane, your librarian and host. Your Ghost Host. So read on... if you dare!<br><br></p><p>Amicus Arcane:Little is known about the dearly departed Amicus Arcane, save for his love of books. As the mansion librarian, both in this life and the afterlife, Amicus has delighted in all forms of the written word. However, this librarian's favorite tales are those of terror and suspense. After all, there is nothing better to ease a restless spirit than a frighteningly good ghost story.<br>John Esposito:When John Esposito met Amicus Arcane on a midnight stroll through New Orleans Square, he was so haunted by the librarian's tales that he decided to transcribe them for posterity. John has worked in both film and television, on projects such as <i>R.L. Stan's The Haunting Hour</i>, <i>Teen Titans</i>, and the webisodes for <i>The Walking Dead</i>, for which he won consecutive Writer's Guide Awards. John lives in New York with his wife and children, and still visits with Amicus from time to time.<br><br>Kelley Jones:For the illustrations accompanying his terrifying tales, Amicus Arcane approached Kelley Jones, an artist with a scary amount of talent. Kelley has worked for every major comic book publisher but is best known for his definitive work on <i>Batman</i> for DC Comics. Kelley lives in Northern California with his wife and children and hears from Amicus every October 31st, whether he wants to or not.Gr 4-7 Middle schoolers Willa, Tim, Noah, and Steve bond over their love of horror and form The Fearsome Foursome, their storytelling club. They meet weekly to share tales of ghosts and ghouls. One day, their headquarters gets demolished in a freakish storm. In the wreckage, the quartet find four fancy invitations to an address on the other side of town. Intrigued, they find it's a Gothic mansion, which seems deserted except for the librarian, who is the keeper of all scary stories. It turns out the librarian has a story to read about each of them, and he insists they will be dying to find out how these tales end. This is the first in a new series based on the Disney theme park ride the Haunted Mansion. The selections are gruesome-some include rotting corpses-but are not too frightening for most middle grade readers. VERDICT An excellent addition for freshening up scary stories collections; hand this to fans who have graduated from "Goosebumps" or are looking for a new scare.&#x2015;<b><i><i>School Library Journal, </i>Beth Cuddy, Seward Elementary School, NY</i></b><br><br>Middle-graders Willa, Tim, Noah, and Steve, the titular Fearsome Foursome, share a love of scary stories, so when they receive a mysterious invitation to meet in a haunted mansion on the other side of town, there's no doubt that the friends will be going. The house is a little unnerving, sure, with ravens cawing overhead, a gothic fa ade, even a pet cemetery to complete the picture, but the kids shrug off the obvious and most likely manufactured forbidding atmosphere; inside, they're mostly skeptical and only slightly frightened when they meet the house's skeletal-like librarian. After betting him that he can't possibly come up with a story that actually scares the group, they grow increasingly terrified as he tells the story of each kid's demise. But of course, it's all fun and games, right? Right? The librarian acts as the book's cheeky (and creepy) narrator, inserting humorous asides that poke fun at typical horror-story tropes. These get old pretty quickly, but the stories themselves are scary on an R. L. Stine level, with just the right number of chills and the right amount of gore, and the episodic nature of the tales makes the book accessible as well as appealing. This is right up the alley of reluctant readers who like a good thrill but not a hefty page count, and it's certainly fodder for campfire storytelling.&#x2015;<b><i><i>Bulletin of the Center for Children?s Books, </i> KQG</i></b></p><h2>Build Your Own Metal Working Shop From Scrap (Complete 7 Book Series)</h2><p>The classic seven book series by Dave Gingery is now available in a special hard bound edition titled, 'Build Your Own Metal Working Shop From Scrap'. This collector's edition contains the newly updated and complete 7 book series including; The Charcoal Foundry, The Metal Lathe, The Metal Shaper, The Milling Machine, The Dividing Head, The Drill Press and The Sheet Metal Brake. <p>Build Your Own Metal Working Shop From Scrap is a progressive series of seven projects. Beginning with a simple charcoal fired foundry, you produce the castings for building the machine tools to equip your shop. Initially the castings are finished by simple hand methods, but it is not long before the developing machines are doing much of the work to produce their own parts. It does not take long to learn the simple craft of pattern-making and sand molding. Each project phase increases your knowledge and skill. There is no need to look for outside help. You can do it all in your own shop. No complicated math----No exotic equipment required----No large cash outlay. Lots of work to be sure, and some of it can be downright tedious, but the reward will be a practical small scale machine shop that you might never give yourself permission to buy, assuming you could afford it. </p></p><p></p><h2>The Meanest Doll in the World (The Doll People, 2)</h2><p>Annabelle Doll and Tiffany Funcraft are two dolls who have been best friends since they met in Kate Palmer&#39;s house at 26 Wetherby Lane. In this sequel to The Doll People, they hitch a ride in Kate&#39;s backpack and find themselves in the biggest adventure of their lives, a day at school! But when an attempt to return home lands them in the wrong house, they&#39;re in far deeper trouble than they imagined. Along with a host of new doll friends, they also encounter Mean Mimi, the wickedest doll of all. Mean Mimi is mean-really mean-and she&#39;s determined to rule all of Dollkind or else destroy it. Will the world ever be safe for dolls again? In this masterfully plotted sequel, Ann M. Martin and Laura Godwin, with the help of Brian Selznick&#39;s ingenious black-and-white illustrations, take the reader on another nonstop adventure from a doll&#39;s eye view!</p><p>Laura Godwin, also known as Nola Buck, is the author of many picture books for children, including <i>What the Baby Hears, Central Park Serenade, Barnyard Prayers, The Flower Girl, Little White Dog </i>and <i>Christmas in the Manger. </i>Born and raised in Alberta, Canada, she now lives in New York City.<br><br>Brian Selznick is the author and illustrator of the <em>New York Times</em> best-selling <em>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</em>, winner of the 2008 Caldecott Medal and a National Book nominee. He has also illustrated many other books for children, including <em>Frindle</em> by Andrew Clements, <em>Amelia and Eleanor Go for a Ride</em> by Pam Mu�oz Ryan, and <em>The Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins</em> by Barbara Kerley, which received a 2001 Caldecott Honor. Brian lives in Brooklyn, New York, and San Diego, California.Lynn Redgrave's reasonable tone and measured reading lend credence to a fantasy about dolls that come to life when humans aren't paying attention. This sequel to THE DOLL PEOPLE, which can stand alone, follows best friends Annabelle and Tiffany as they find adventure. Redgrave sensitively takes cues from the text to create voices for the characters. Annabelle and her family have light British accents appropriate for dolls crafted in England in 1898. Plastic Tiffany has a squeaky and distinctly American voice. The paper dolls have breathy singsong voices, and Mean Mimi sounds believably mean. Well-timed side breaks combine with Redgrave's performance to create a light and fun listen.

It stood on the mantelpiece in the parlor, and every night before he went to bed he took the key from a vase, and wound it up. Once a year the clockman came from Winchester, on an old jogging packhorse, to clean and oil it and put it right. Afterward he would drink camomile tea with my mother, and tell her the news of the city and what he had learned in the villages through which he had passed. My father, if he were not busy milling, would stalk out at this time, with some contemptuous remark about gossip; but later, in the evening, I would hear my mother passing the stories on to him. He did not show much enthusiasm, but he listened to them.<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s great treasure, though, was not the clock, but the Watch. This, a miniature clock with a dial less than an inch across and a circlet permitting it to be worn on the wrist, was kept in a locked drawer of his desk; and only brought out to be worn on ceremonial occasions, like Harvest Festival, or a Capping. The clockman was only allowed to see to it every third year, and at such times my father stood by, watching him as he worked. There was no other Watch in the village, nor in any of the villages round about. The clockman said there were a number in Winchester, but none as fine as this. I wondered if he said it to please my father, who certainly showed pleasure in the hearing, but I believe it truly was of very good workmanship. The body of the Watch was of a steel much superior to anything they could make at the forge in Alton, and the works inside were a wonder of intricacy and skill. On the front was printed &#x201c;Anti-magnetique Incabloc,&#x201d; which we supposed must have been the name of the craftsman who made it in olden times.<br> <br>The clockman had visited us the week before, and I had been permitted to look on for a time while he cleaned and oiled the Watch. The sight fascinated me, and after he had gone I found my thoughts running continually on this treasure, now locked away again in its drawer. I was, of course, forbidden to touch my father&#x2019;s desk and the notion of opening a locked drawer in it should have been unthinkable. Nonetheless, the idea persisted. And after a day or two, I admitted to myself that it was only the fear of being caught that prevented me.<br> <br>On Saturday morning, I found myself alone in the house. My father was in the mill room, grinding, and the servants&#x2014;even Molly who normally did not leave the house during the day&#x2014;had been brought in to help. My mother was out visiting old Mrs. Ash, who was sick, and would be gone an hour at least. I had finished my homework, and there was nothing to stop my going out into the bright May morning and finding Jack. But what completely filled my mind was the thought that I had this opportunity to look at the Watch, with small chance of detection.<br> <br>The key, I had observed, was kept with the other keys in a small box beside my father&#x2019;s bed. There were four, and the third one opened the drawer. I took out the Watch, and gazed at it. It was not going, but I knew one wound it and set the hands by means of the small knob at one side. If I were to wind it only a couple of turns it would run down quite soon&#x2014;just in case my father decided to look at it later in the day. I did this, and listened to its quiet rhythmic ticking. Then I set the hands by the clock. After that it only remained for me to slip it on my wrist. Even notched to the first hole, the leather strap was loose; but I was wearing the Watch.<br> <br>Having achieved what I had thought was an ultimate ambition, I found, as I think is often the case, that there remained something more. To wear it was a triumph, but to be seen wearing it ... I had told my cousin, Jack Leeper, that I would meet him that morning, in the old ruins at the end of the village. Jack, who was nearly a year older than myself and due to be presented at the next Capping, was the person, next to my parents, that I most admired. To take the Watch out of the house was to add enormity to disobedience, but having already gone so far, it was easier to contemplate it. My mind made up, I was determined to waste none of the precious time I had. I opened the front door, stuck the hand with the Watch deep into my trouser pocket, and ran off down the street.<br> <br>The village lay at a crossroads, with the road in which our house stood running alongside the river (this giving power for the mill, of course) and the second road crossing it at the ford. Beside the ford stood a small wooden bridge for foot travelers, and I pelted across, noticing that the river was higher than usual from the spring rains. My Aunt Lucy was approaching the bridge as I left it at the far end. She called a greeting to me, and I called back, having first taken care to veer to the other side of the road. The baker&#x2019;s shop was there, with trays of buns and cakes set out, and it was reasonable that I should be heading that way: I had a couple of pennies in my pocket. But I ran on past it, and did not slacken to a walk until I had reached the point where the houses thinned out and at last ended.<br> <br>The ruins were a hundred yards farther on. On one side of the road lay Spiller&#x2019;s meadow, with cows grazing, but on my side there was a thorn hedge, and a potato field beyond. I passed a gap in the hedge, not looking in my concentration on what I was going to show Jack, and was startled a moment later by a shout from behind me. I recognized the voice as Henry Parker&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Henry, like Jack, was a cousin of mine&#x2014;my name is Will Parker&#x2014;but, unlike Jack, no friend. (I had several cousins in the village: people did not usually travel far to marry.) He was a month younger than I, but taller and heavier, and we had hated each other as long as I could remember. When it came to fighting, as it very often did, I was outmatched physically, and had to rely on agility and quickness if I were not going to be beaten. From Jack I had learned some skill in wrestling which, in the past year, had enabled me to hold my own more, and in our last encounter I had thrown him heavily enough to wind him and leave him gasping for breath. But for wrestling one needed the use of both hands. I thrust my left hand deeper into the pocket and, not answering his call, ran on toward the ruins.<br> <br>He was closer than I had thought, though, and he pounded after me, yelling threats. I put a spurt on, looked back to see how much of a lead I had, and found myself slipping on a patch of mud. (Cobbles were laid inside the village, but out here the road was in its usual poor condition, aggravated by the rains.) I fought desperately to keep my footing, but would not, until it was too late, bring out my other hand to help balance myself. As a result, I went slithering and sprawling and finally fell. Before I could recover, Henry was kneeling across me, holding the back of my head with his hand and pushing my face down into the mud.<br> <br>This activity would normally have kept him happy for some time, but he found something of greater interest. I had instinctively used both hands to protect myself as I fell, and he saw the Watch on my wrist. In a moment he had wrenched it off, and stood up to examine it. I scrambled to my feet, and made a grab, but he held it easily above his head and out of my reach.<br> <br>I said, panting, &#x201c;Give that back!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not yours,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your father&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was in agony in case the Watch had been damaged, broken maybe, in my fall, but even so I attempted to get my leg between his, to drop him. He parried, and, stepping back, said,<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep your distance.&#x201d; He braced himself, as though preparing to throw a stone. &#x201c;Or I&#x2019;ll see how far I can fling it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you do,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll get a whipping for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a grin on his fleshy face. &#x201c;So will you. And your father lays on heavier than mine does. I&#x2019;ll tell you what: I&#x2019;ll borrow it for a while. Maybe I&#x2019;ll let you have it back this afternoon. Or tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone will see you with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He grinned again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll risk that.&#x201d;<br> <br>I made a grab at him, I had decided that he was bluffing about throwing it away. I almost got him off balance, but not quite. We swayed and struggled, and then crashed together and rolled down into the ditch by the side of the road. There was some water in it, but we went on fighting, even after a voice challenged us from above. Jack&#x2014;for it was he who had called to us to get up&#x2014;had to come down and pull us apart by force. This was not difficult for him. He was as big as Henry, and tremendously strong also. He dragged us back up to the road, got to the root of the matter, took the Watch off Henry, and dismissed him with a clip across the back of the neck.<br> <br>I said tearfully, &#x201c;Is it all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think so.&#x201d; He examined it, and handed it to me. &#x201c;But you were a fool to bring it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wanted to show it to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not worth it,&#x201d; he said briefly. &#x201c;Anyway, we&#x2019;d better see about getting it back. I&#x2019;ll lend a hand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack had always been around to a lend a hand, as long as I could remember. It was strange, I thought, as we walked toward the village, that in just over a week&#x2019;s time I would be on my own. The Capping would have taken place, and Jack would be a boy no longer.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Jack stood guard while I put the Watch back and returned the drawer key to the place where I had found it. I changed my wet and dirty trousers and shirt, and we retraced our steps to the ruins. No one knew what these buildings had once been, and I think one of the things that attracted us was a sign, printed on a chipped and rusted metal plate:<br> DANGER<br>6,600 VOLTS<p></p> <br>We had no idea what Volts had been, but the notion of danger, however far away and long ago, was exciting. There was more lettering, but for the most part the rust had destroyed it. LECT CITY: we wondered if that were the city it had come from.<br> <br>Farther along was the den Jack had made. One approached it through a crumbling arch; inside it was dry, and there was a place to build a fire. Jack had made one before coming out to look for me, and had skinned, cleaned, and skewered a rabbit ready for us to grill. There would be food in plenty at home&#x2014;the midday meal on a Saturday was always lavish&#x2014;but this did not prevent my looking forward greedily to roast rabbit with potatoes baked in the embers of the fire. Nor would it stop me doing justice to the steak pie my mother had in the oven. Although on the small side, I had a good appetite.<br> <br>We watched and smelled the rabbit cooking in companionable silence. We could get on very well together without much conversation, though normally I had a ready tongue. Too ready, perhaps&#x2014;I knew that a lot of the trouble with Henry arose because I could not avoid trying to get a rise out of him whenever possible.<br> <br>Jack was not much of a talker under any circumstances, but to my surprise, after a time he broke the silence. His talk was inconsequential at first, chatter about events that had taken place in the village, but I had the feeling that he was trying to get around to something else, something more important. Then he stopped, stared in silence for a second or two at the crisping carcass, and said,<br> <br>&#x201c;This place will be yours, after the Capping.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was difficult to know what to say. I suppose if I had thought about it at all, I would have expected that he would pass the den on to me, but I had not thought about it. One did not think much about things connected with the Cappings, and certainly did not talk about them. For Jack, of all people, to do so was surprising, but what he said next was more surprising still.<br> <br>&#x201c;In a way,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I almost hope it doesn&#x2019;t work. I&#x2019;m not sure I wouldn&#x2019;t rather be a Vagrant.&#x201d;<br> <br>I should say something about the Vagrants. Every village generally had a few&#x2014;at that time there were four in ours, as far as I knew&#x2014;but the number was constantly changing as some moved off and others took their place. They occasionally did a little work, but whether they did or not the village supported them. They lived in the Vagrant House, which in our case stood on the corner where the two roads crossed and was larger than all but a handful of houses (my father&#x2019;s being one). It could easily have accommodated a dozen Vagrants, and there had been times when there had been almost that many there. Food was supplied to them&#x2014;it was not luxurious, but adequate&#x2014;and a servant looked after the place. Other servants were sent to lend a hand when the House filled up.<br> <br>What was known, though not discussed, was that the Vagrants were people for whom the Capping had proved a failure. They had Caps, as normal people did, but they were not working properly. If this were going to happen, it usually showed itself in the first day or two following a Capping: the person who had been Capped showed distress, which increased as the days went by, turning at last into a fever of the brain. In this state, they were clearly in much pain. Fortunately the crisis did not last long; fortunately also, it happened only rarely. The great majority of Cappings were entirely successful. I suppose only about one in twenty produced a Vagrant.<br> <br>When he was well again, the Vagrant would start his wanderings. He, or she; because it happened occasionally with girls, although much more rarely. Whether it was because they saw themselves as being outside the community of normal people, or because the fever had left a permanent restlessness in them, I did not know. But off they would go and wander through the land, stopping a day here, as long as a month there, but always moving on. Their minds, certainly, had been affected. None of them could settle to a train of thought for long, and many had visions, and did strange things.<br> <br>They were taken for granted, and looked after, but, like the Cappings, not much talked about. Children, generally, viewed them with suspicion and avoided them. They, for their part, mostly seemed melancholy, and did not talk much, even to each other. It was a great shock to hear Jack say he half wished to be a Vagrant, and I did not know how to answer him. But he did not seem to need a response. He said, &#x201c;The Watch&#x2014;do you ever think what it must have been like in the days when things like that were made?&#x201d;<br> <br>I had, from time to time, but it was another subject on which speculation was not encouraged, and Jack had never talked in this way before. I said, &#x201c;Before the Tripods?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we know it was the Black Age. There were too many people, and not enough food, so that people starved, and fought each other, and there were all kinds of sicknesses, and ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And things like the Watch were made&#x2014;by men, not the Tripods.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;four years ago, when I went to stay with my Aunt Matilda?&#x201d;<br> <br>I remembered. She was his aunt, not mine, even though we were cousins: she had married a foreigner. Jack said, &#x201c;She lives at Bishopstoke, on the other side of Winchester. I went out one day, walking, and I came to the sea. There were the ruins of a city that must have been twenty times as big as Winchester.&#x201d;<br> <br>I knew of the ruined great-cities of the ancients, of course. But these, too, were little talked of, and then with disapproval and a shade of dread. No one would dream of going near...</p><h2>School of Sewing: Learn it. Teach it.

These feel like betrayal because they violate the implicit promise of emotional bonds, that your loved one will care about your wellbeing and never intentionally hurt you. If you've recently left a relationship where you felt betrayed by your partner&#x2015;or if you want to repair one&#x2015;it can seem impossible to view the world without the shadow of past betrayal hovering over you. As a result, you may struggle to create meaning in your life, find the strength to forgive, or build new, loving relationships.<br><br>In<em><strong>Living and Loving after Betrayal</strong></em>, therapist and relationship expert Steven Stosny offers effective tools for healing, based on his highly successful CompassionPower program. He founded the CompassionPower agency on the belief that we are more powerful when compassionate than when angry or aggressive, and that true strength comes from relating compassionately to others and remaining true to your deeper values. In this book, you&#x2019;ll learn practical strategies for overcoming betrayal-induced trauma and the chronic resentment and depression that result, using this innovative compassion-empowerment approach.<br><br>Most books on betrayal only focus on the obvious issues, such as infidelity, abuse, or sex addiction. This book explores the effects of those kinds of betrayal, as well as less-talked-about types, such as emotional manipulation, dishonesty, deceit, and financial cheating. In addition, the book helps you regain a sense of trust in others so that you can eventually find another compassionate person to share your life with or, if you choose, to rebuild a relationship with your reformed betrayer.<br><br>Recovering from the betrayal of partner isn&#x2019;t easy, but <em><strong>Living and Loving after Betrayal</strong></em>offers potent ways to heal, grow, and love again.</p><p><strong>Steven Stosny, PhD</strong>, is founder of CompassionPower, a successful anger-regulation program that he has directed for more than twenty years.

Through rhyming stanzas, children can count from one to 10, using bolillos, burbujas, paraguas, and calaveras along the way.

The book is playful and fun to read and offers plenty of opportunities for bilingual vocabulary development, incorporating recognizable symbols of Latinx cultural heritage. Short, catchy text will hold the attention of very young learners and add to the book's buoyant appeal. Brightly colored, animated illustrations blend the imaginative with the realistic and complement the singsong rhythm, with words and pictures evenly placed throughout. Colors are vibrant, with a diversity of skin tones represented. Plenty of space around the text will facilitate letter recognition and comprehension for beginning readers; Spanish and English words are woven together seamlessly, accurately relating concepts in both languages.

Average-quality full- color illustrations depict the flora and fauna that thrive in this harsh environment, but no distinction is made between the plants and animals found in the American West and those of the other desert areas. This may cause a great deal of confusion. The author makes mention of some of the natural resources that have been found "under desert floors," but again doesn't cite specific locations. The lifestyle of desert people is touched upon, but there is no indication as to which continents these nomads might roam.

He ultimately came to live with a foster family, where he endured near-constant verbal and physical abuse. In his mid-teens he escaped and enlisted in the navy, where he became a man of the world, raised by the family he created for himself.</p><p><em>Finding Fish</em> shows how, out of this unlikely mix of deprivation and hope, an artist was born -- first as the child who painted the feelings his words dared not speak, then as a poet and storyteller who would eventually become one of Hollywood's most sought-after screenwriters.</p><p>A tumultuous and ultimately gratifying tale of self-discovery written in Fisher's gritty yet melodic literary voice, <em>Finding Fish</em> is an unforgettable reading experience.</p></p><p>Thank goodness Antwone Fisher's story has a happy ending--otherwise, his searing memoir would be nearly unbearable to read. His father was killed by a gunshot blast shortly before he was born in 1959; his 17-year-old mother gave him up for foster care. Unfortunately for Antwone, his foster mother was as successful at browbeating and demeaning her many wards as she was at lying to the Child Welfare authorities. His working-class African American neighborhood in Cleveland became purgatory for a sensitive, intelligent boy who quickly turned into a withdrawn underperformer at school. In Fisher's blow-by-blow account of his childhood, his sexual abuse at the hands of a female neighbor is hardly more horrifying than his foster mother's relentless cruelty--especially because respectable, churchgoing Mrs. Pickett justifies it all as due to the boy's wicked faults. Readers will be relieved when she dumps 15-year-old Antwone back at the Child Welfare office, even though he will endure homelessness and a scary spell of criminal employment, before an 11-year stint in the Navy provides him with a way forward. Grim though his tale is, Fisher displays throughout it the grit and stubborn integrity that kept him sane. He musters up some understanding (not forgiveness) for the dreadful Mrs. Pickett, and his eventual meeting with his burned-out mother is painfully poignant. He certainly deserves the beautiful wife and cute two-year-old daughter, cooking pancakes for him in the book's closing and redemptive scene. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Antwone Fisher is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Finding Fish.</em> He is also the screenwriter of the film <em>Antwone Fisher,</em> based on his life and directed by Academy Award winner Denzel Washington. Fisher lives in Los Angeles with his wife and two daughters.<br><br><p>Mim Eichler Rivas is the author of the acclaimed <em>Beautiful Jim Key</em>, as well as the coauthor of more than eighteen books, including <em>The Pursuit of Happyness</em> and <em>Finding Fish with Antwone Fisher</em>.</p></p><h2>Letters from Hollywood: Inside the Private World of Classic American Moviemaking</h2><p><b>Rare&nbsp;notes, memos, and telegrams from Humphrey Bogart, Audrey Hepburn, Frank Sinatra, Jane Fonda, and more</b><br> &nbsp;<br><i>Letters from Hollywood </i>reproduces in full color scores of entertaining and insightful pieces of correspondence from some of the most notable and talented film industry names of all time&#x2014;from the silent era to the golden age, and up through the pre-email days of the 1970s.

Some were captured and became prisoners of war. Some men evaded capture and were missing in action for months before making it back to England. Their individual stories and those of the courageous Belgian people who risked their lives to help them are all different and are all remarkable. </p> <p>Even before the dramatic battle in the air and the subsequent harrowing events on the ground, the story is informative, insightful, and captivating. Prior to the fateful event, the book covers the crew's training, their journey to England, what life was like on base as well as in London and the English countryside, and the perils of flying combat missions over occupied Europe and Germany. </p> <p>Through personal letters, oral and written accounts, declassified military documents, and interviews - all from people who took part in the events that happened over 70 years ago (even the German Luftwaffe pilot who shot down the Susan Ruth) - the stories come alive. Adding to the feeling of "being there", are more than 200 time period photographs interspersed throughout the book.</p> <p>To add background and context, many historical facts and anecdotes about and surrounding World War II are entwined throughout the book so that the reader has a feel for and understanding of what was occurring on a broader scale. SHOT DOWN is an account about brave individuals, featuring pilot Howard Snyder, set within the compelling events of the greatest conflict in world history. </p></p><p><b>Belgium ...

Winner of the most important comics awards for newcomers, the Tetsuya Chiba Awad in 2001, Oshima has been penning quirky slice-of-life dramas now for over a decade for major manga publishers including Kodansha. After drawing nine series, Oshimi's star began to rise in 2008 with the release of his first hit, <i>Drifting Net Cafe</i>. This horror-themed homage to the legendary Kazu Umezzo work, <i>Drifting Classroom</i>, was adapted into a live-action series, and propelled Oshimi onto an international stage. He would soon reach new heights in 2009 with <i>The Flowers of Evil.</i> In 2010 and 2011, the property quietly landed on numerous must-read lists and helped revitalize the shonen genre.&#x201c;While Oshimi&#x2019;s works are often disturbing and unsettling, they are rarely without positive endings and character redemption. This perhaps speaks to Oshimi&#x2019;s motives in writing these bizarre, yet grounded horror stories. While our lives are fragile and not entirely our own, we have to make the best of them. In this way, Oshimi&#x2019;s works are fable-like. By exploring the darker aspects of our world, he emphasizes the importance of perspective and the individual. <i>The Flowers of Evil</i> [is], in this sense, a classic coming-of-age tale.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>ComicsVerse</i></p><h2>Auto Repair and Maintenance: Easy Lessons for Maintaining Your Car So It Lasts Longer (Idiot&#39;s Guides)</h2><p>Cars continue to be more complicated &#x2014; and more costly to repair.

He lives in Missoula, Montana.K-Gr. 3. This brightly illustrated, large-format volume invites children to consider the varying physical qualities and purposes of different birds' beaks. Each spread spotlights one or two species and how they use their beaks. A brief line of text, printed in large type and conveying an essential idea, is followed by a paragraph of information about the bird shown in the illustration. For instance, the section on macaws begins, "heavy beaks crush," and explains how the macaw's strong beak enables it to eat nuts that other birds cannot crack. This arrangement offers a brief introduction for younger children and a longer one for older ones. Focusing on the narrow topics of beaks allows Collard to be quite specific, but it also offers opportunities to introduce more general principles such as evolution. The term "paper collage" doesn't convey the three-dimensional quality of Brickman's striking pictures. Constructed of painted and cut papers, they give the illusion of depth in the picture plane as well as rounding shapes in the figures of individual birds. Short lists of recommended books and Web sites round out this attractive and informative volume. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Although diagnosed with Parkinson&#x2019;s, my father lived an active and productive life until his death at age 94.

It helps them cope with the shock of diagnosis, gives them (jargon-free) the scientific basics they need to know, describes the symptoms they may experience (making clear that every case is different) and catalogs the resources available to navigate living with Parkinson&#x2019;s. John humanizes the book by describing his own experience and that of 22 other patients and their partners.

The case would become one of the most famous in modern medicine&#x2014;and a total failure. <em>As Nature Made Him</em> tells the extraordinary story of David Reimer, who, when finally informed of his medical history, made the decision to live as a male. A macabre tale of medical arrogance, it is first and foremost a human drama of one man's&#x2014;and one family's&#x2014;amazing survival in the face of terrible odds.<p></p></p><p>Once you begin reading <i>As Nature Made Him</i>, a mesmerizing story of a medical tragedy and its traumatic results, you absolutely won't want to put it down. Following a botched circumcision, a family is convinced to raise their infant son, Bruce, as a girl. They rename the child Brenda and spend the next 14 years trying to transform him into a her. Brenda's childhood reads as one filled with anxiety and loneliness, and her fear and confusion are present on nearly every page concerning her early childhood. Much of her pain is caused by Dr. Money, who is presented as a villainous medical man attempting to coerce an unwilling child to submit to numerous unpleasant treatments.<p> Reading over interviews and reports of decisions made by this doctor, it's difficult to contain anger at the widespread results of his insistence that natural-born gender can be altered with little more than willpower and hormone treatments. The attempts of his parents, twin brother, and extended family to assist Brenda to be happily female are touching--the sense is overwhelmingly of a family wanting to do "right" while being terribly mislead as to what "right" is for her. As Brenda makes the decision to live life as a male (at age 14), she takes the name David and begins the process of reversing the effects of estrogen treatments. David's ultimately successful life--a solid marriage, honest and close family relationships, and his bravery in making his childhood public--bring an uplifting end to his story. Equally fascinating is the latest segment of the longtime nature/nurture controversy, and the interviews of various psychological researchers and practitioners form a larger framework around David's struggle to live as the gender he was meant to be. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p>John Colapinto has written for <em>Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Esquire, Mademoiselle, Us Weekly,</em> and <em>Rolling Stone,</em> where the landmark National Magazine Award-winning article that was the basis for <em>As Nature Made Him</em> first appeared.

You&#x2019;ll find this book jam-packed with new thinking from these vibrant classrooms. You&#x2019;ll grapple with big ideas: How is taking risks inherent to mathematics? How do mathematicians balance intuition and proof? How can teachers value both productive mistakes and precision? You&#x2019;ll also find dozens of practical teaching techniques you can try in your classroom right away&#x2014;strategies to stimulate students to connect ideas; rich tasks that encourage students to wonder, generalize, conjecture, and persevere; routines to teach students how to collaborate.<br> &nbsp;<br> All teachers can move toward increasingly authentic, delightful, robust mathematics teaching and learning for themselves and their students. This important book helps us develop instructional techniques that will make the math classes we teach so much better than the math classes we took.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p>Tracy happily taught fourth grade in a public school near Seattle for several years. When her family moved to New England and their daughters came along, she gave up her classroom to work with pre-service teachers and their in-service mentors. After many years in adult education in a wide range of grade levels and urban, suburban, and rural schools, Tracy began extensive field research for&nbsp;<i>Becoming the Math Teacher You Wish You&#x2019;d Had: Ideas and Strategies from Vibrant Classrooms</i>. She now splits her time between editing math and science professional development books for Stenhouse Publishers and working with the teachers and students of Rollinsford Grade School as a K-6 math coach. Tracy has facilitated a dramatic shift in the math teaching and learning over time at Rollinsford, and she finds her work and relationships there tremendously gratifying.</p><p>Tracy is regularly invited to present at major conferences in mathematics education, and she enjoys interacting with colleagues before, during, and after workshops through twitter (@tracyzager) and her blog (tjzager.com). She's happiest when she is in classrooms, learning together with teachers and students over time, and she hopes to return to full-time teaching someday.</p><p>Tracy, her husband, and their children jump at the chance to travel, after which they appreciate returning home to their peaceful old house and rambunctious two dogs in Portland, Maine.</p>Tracy Zager&#x2019;s new book &#x2018;Becoming the Math Teacher You Wish You&#x2019;d Had&#x2018; is out, and it&#x2019;s a treat.&nbsp;The central tenet of this important book is to &#x2018;close the gap&#x2019; by making maths class more like mathematics, orienting our students towards the habits of mind of professional mathematicians. &#x2018;Good teaching starts with us&#x2019; and Tracy companionably guides us through ten practices of mathematicians: taking risks, making mistakes, being precise, rising to a challenge, asking questions, connecting ideas, using intuition, reasoning, proving, working together and alone.<br> Tracy skillfully blends academic research, illuminating classroom dialogues, the thoughts of mathematicians and maths educators, and her own perceptive observations. This seamless mix is a real strength of the&nbsp;book; we not only see what habits are important and why, but how they can be enacted through specific teaching strategies, and the powerful effects they have on our students&#x2019; development as confident and capable mathematicians. The reader can&#x2019;t help but be inspired by the teachers that Tracy holds up as exemplars of good practice. These teachers have so much respect for each of their students as serious mathematical thinkers. I was struck by the extent to which they would go to adapt instruction in response to student ideas and to support them in pursuing their own line of enquiry.<br> Tracy warns early on that the book is long&#x2014;and it may be&#x2014;but it is also captivating! The organization is immensely practical; each chapter can be used as a self-contained guide for a particular mathematical habit. I can see myself repeatedly delving back into specific habits as the teaching year progresses. I read it cover-to-cover over a couple of days while curled up in a secluded cabin, pausing occasionally to stare out into the Australian bush and ponder what I can change in my own teaching. Some of my highlighted passages:<ul><li>From Chapter 3, Mathematicians Take Risks:&nbsp;&#x2018;<i>When we assign problems that have a single, closed path from start to finish, we&#x2019;ve eliminated the possibility that students will take mathematical risks.&nbsp;<b>There&#x2019;s nothing to try if everything is prescribed.</b>&#x2018;&nbsp;</i>(pg 49)<i>.&nbsp;</i>In my skills-based courses, I too infrequently give students opportunities to try and be successful with their own approaches. That&#x2019;s something to work on.</li><li>From Chapter 4, Mathematicians Make Mistakes: &#x2018;<i>If we want students to learn from mistakes, we need to teach them how.&#x2019;&nbsp;</i>(pg 57).&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracy outlines a three-part goal: to teach students to take mistakes in their stride, to keep going when they&#x2019;ve made a mistake, and the one I need to focus on:&nbsp;<i>&#x2018;<b>to teach students to make the most of the knowledge and experience they gained by figuring out their mistake</b>&#x2018;.&nbsp;</i>How can I help students gain the skills to diagnose and learn from their mistakes, by themselves?</li><li>From Chapter 5, Mathematicians Are Precise: &#x2018;<b><i>Math without inquiry is lifeless, but math without rigor is aimless.</i></b><i>&nbsp;There is no tension between teaching students how to solve problems accurately and efficiently and teaching students how to formulate conjectures, critique reasoning, develop mathematical arguments, use multiple representations, think flexibly, and focus on conceptual understanding.&#x2019;&nbsp;</i>(pg 80). In my problem-solving course, I deliberately swung the pendulum from the typical procedure-based courses my students had mostly experienced towards creative, collaborative problem-solving. But I also need to find the middleground, where I place as much emphasis on rigour as I do on inquiry.</li><li>From Chapter 12, Mathematicians Work Together and Alone: &#x2018;<i>If a major part of doing mathematics involves interacting with other mathematicians, then a major part of teaching students mathematics must be to teach students how, why, and whether to interact with one another mathematically.&nbsp;Students need to learn how to ask for what they need from each other and to be what they need for each other&nbsp;...&nbsp;<b>we need to teach students how to be good colleagues&nbsp;</b>...<b>&nbsp;it&#x2019;s important we honor individual thinking and working time.&nbsp;</b>It&#x2019;s not reasonable to expect students to collaborate at every moment, and that&#x2019;s not how mathematicians work.&#x2019;</i>&nbsp;(pg 312). This past semester, a few students in my problem-solving course commented that they needed more opportunities to work alone first, and more strategies to work effectively with group members. I&#x2019;ll definitely be digging further into this chapter next year.</li></ul>And, these phrases are going straight into my repertoire: <ul><li><i>&#x2018;Do you have more questions after doing this? What are you wondering about now?&nbsp;</i>(pg 149).</li><li><i>&#x2018;What does ______ have to do with _____?&#x2019;&nbsp;</i>(Debbie Nicols, pg 191).</li><li><i>&#x2018;Remember that it&#x2019;s hard to find mistakes when you assume that you&#x2019;re right. So go back into it assuming something went wrong.&#x2019;&nbsp;</i>(Jennifer Clerkin Muhammad, pg 284).</li><li><i>&#x2018;Would you recommend that strategy to someone you like?&#x2019;&nbsp;</i>(pg 118).&nbsp;</li></ul>There is so much to love about this book. The writing is both encouraging and empowering. It&#x2019;s labelled K-8 but Tracy offers important insights to help teachers across&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;year levels; I have been nodding furiously and making notes throughout. This particular passage had me shouting &#x2018;yes!&#x2019;:<br><i>&#x2018;We need to give ourselves permission to say, publicly, and with delight, &#x201c;I never thought about it that way before!&#x201d; whether it refers to addition, fractions, or place value. It is long past time for us to respect the beauty, power, and importance of elementary mathematics, instead of having contempt for &#x201c;the basics.&#x201d;&#x2019; (pg 208)</i><br> Listening carefully to student thinking,<i>&nbsp;especially about ideas I thought I understood,&nbsp;</i>always gives me new insight. It&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ll never tire of teaching.<br> I can confidently say that, alongside &#x2018;Thinking Mathematically&#x2018; (Mason, Burton and Stacey, 1982; 2010), Tracy&#x2019;s book will become a cornerstone for my teaching. It is a gift to all maths teachers. But don&#x2019;t just take my word for it; you can preview the book in its entirety&nbsp;here. The companion website promises more, and I can&#x2019;t wait to look around!<br> Wonder in Mathematics<br> Dr Amie Albrecht<br><br>Becoming the Math Teacher You Wish You'd Had: Ideas and Strategies from Vibrant Classrooms addresses the common gap between mathematicians who perceive math as creative and fun and students who view it is boring at best and frustrating at worst, and helps teachers move students from dull math classes to more vibrant, lively productions. The author spent years with many math teachers in a wide range of settings and grades to collect the successful strategies that would reach grades K-8 through this collection. Chapters offer examples of innovative teaching methods, measurable results in improving math comprehension and usage, and include strategies, examinations of conjectures, and tips on how to lead math students to make new, exciting connections. The result is a powerful survey highly recommended for any math instructor seeking specific keys to not just teaching the basics, but making math relevant and exciting.<br> Midwest Book Review<br><br>I am not a math person. That side of my brain totally freezes once I enter a math class or have a problem in front of me. I guess I haven&#x2019;t had good luck when it comes to figuring out why&nbsp;<i>x</i>&nbsp;and y are in the same problems as numbers. But this might just be because I haven&#x2019;t had a successful math class yet.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a pre-service teacher preparing for a career that might include teaching math in a self-contained classroom, I actually felt hopeful again after reading&nbsp;<i>Becoming the Math Teacher You Wish You&#x2019;d Had</i>&nbsp;and encouraged to learn math from the strategies Tracy Johnston Zager enthused about.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>What I found inside</b><br> She opens the book with a personal story about how her mother used to become stressed and drew blanks whenever a math problem would come up. Similarly, that&#x2019;s how I feel. But she goes on to say how incredibly skillful her mother was in math, just not in the traditional way. Rather she was adept with money and in measuring for everyday use.<br> The author understands how math should be more than just classrooms where the students knock out problem after problem with no real connection or value to the effort. That is how math has become a negative subject and why non-mathematically excited people freeze once someone even mentions the word&nbsp;<i>math</i>.<br> Zager offers solutions to help with the anxiety that so many of us feel, while telling engaging stories from real classrooms to help us visualize students in action.<br><b>Making connections for our learners</b><br> In order to improve the situation in math class, Zager believes we must ask the question, &#x201c;What is Math?&#x201d; This might be a simple question, one that could be answered by a formal definition. However, that won&#x2019;t help us when it comes to teaching math to a classroom full of students who have the mindset of &#x201c;math is hard and I won&#x2019;t ever use it!&#x201d;<br> Throughout many helpful chapters, Zager explains how math must be taught with connections to instances where the students will encounter&nbsp;<i>such</i>&nbsp;a need for math that they are ready to make it their own &#x2013; becoming risk-takers and asking questions rather than supplying answers.<br> Wouldn&#x2019;t math class have been a lot more fun if there had been a lesson on how math can be applied to the &#x201c;real world&#x201d; by bringing in people with different careers and having them explain what kind of math they do in their job? I would have been much more engaged with doing the work if I had known math had a purpose outside the walls of the classroom. Zager explains this concept well in a chapter on making connections, as she tells stories about different teachers who have used this strategy effectively in their classrooms.<br> As I read the book, I noticed that each time Zager stated her claim for a chapter, she always followed up by providing vivid examples with real conversations that different students have had in trying to understand the value of math. These conversations help articulate and give life to otherwise complex statements and provide us with real examples of what collaboration looks like in each instance.<br> Many of the figures in this book are actual pictures of student work and photos of lessons. These accent the conversations and examples well, engaging the readers and helping them understand what is being said.<br> The book is also very easy to follow with big headings on each concept and common questions that many teachers might ask. Each chapter is titled &#x201c;Mathematicians...&#x201d; to imply that any student of math is a mathematician and should be called such.<br><b>What&#x2019;s most important to me</b><br> I hope to someday be an elementary school teacher who is ready and willing to teach math.&nbsp;<i>Becoming the Math Teacher You Wish You&#x2019;d Had</i>&nbsp;offers me a sense of hope that I am capable of teaching a more fun and engaging math class for every student.<br> Math concepts can be hard for me to absorb when I&#x2019;m learning them, not to mention trying to teach them to someone else. After reading this book, though, I have found a sense of confidence and security that I can teach this rigorous subject, and I can teach it using these inspiring strategies.<br> My goal for my students is to help them gain full ownership of mathematical learning. Using strategies like discussing the theories in math and coming up with questions (rather than just providing answers), as Tracy Johnston Zager writes about in&nbsp;<i>Becoming the Math Teach You Wish You&#x2019;d Had</i>, makes it more likely I will succeed.<br><b><i>Emmy Avery Witham</i></b><i>&nbsp;is a student at College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, ME and is studying to be a certified teacher.

This is the bit I liked:<br> That&#x2019;s what I thought about it at the time, but I haven&#x2019;t sat down to organise my thoughts on it. Until now.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was first drawn to the book based entirely on its contents page.<br> Check this out:<br> Chapter 1: Breaking the Cycle<br> Chapter 2: What Do Mathematicians Do?<br> Chapter 3: Mathematicians Take Risks<br> Chapter 4: Mathematicians Make Mistakes<br> Chapter 5: Mathematicians Are Precise<br> Chapter 6: Mathematicians Rise to a Challenge<br> Chapter 7: Mathematicians Ask Questions<br> Chapter 8: Mathematicians Connect Ideas<br> Chapter 9: Mathematicias Use Intuition<br> Chapter 10: Mathematicians Reason<br> Chapter 11: Mathematicians Prove<br> Chapter 12: Mathematicians Work Together and Alone<br> Chapter 13: &#x201c;Favourable Conditions&#x201d; for All Maths Students<br> &nbsp;<br> Is this not awesome? Here was a list articulating things about maths that I know are important and yet that I&#x2019;ve struggled to articulate all my life as a mathematician and maths educator. Many of them cut straight to the heart of the difference between how I experience mathematics and how it usually is experienced in a classroom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mathematicians use intuition&#x201d; you say? Well, yes. Yes we do. But many a maths classroom is about following rules and avoiding the need for intuition.<br> &#x201c;Mathematicians work together&#x201d; you say? Well, yes. Yes we do. But so many students think maths is only a solitary activity.<br> &#x201c;Mathematicians make mistakes&#x201d; you say? Well, yes. Yes we do. But mistakes are feared and avoided in most maths classes.<br> &#x201c;Mathemaicians connect ideas&#x201d; you say? Well, yes. Yes we do. But so many maths curriculums are just so many piles of disconnected procedures, even here at my own university.<br> &nbsp;<br> The contents page promised a book about the most important aspects of mathematical work and thinking, and a hope that it would give ways to bring these into the experiences of students in all maths classrooms.<br> &nbsp;<br> And the hope was made real.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each chapter starts out comparing how mathematicians talk about what they do and what students&#x2019; experience of it is. Then it moves on to detailed examples of the aspect of maths thinking in action in real classrooms, as well as strategies to encourage it both in your students and in yourself as a teacher.<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t expect to see this last point about encouraging these attitudes and thinking in yourself as a teacher. Yet it is the most compelling feature of the book for me. Indeed, I don&#x2019;t think the book would have had nearly the impact it had on me (or the impact I see it having on others) without this constant message that to help your students experience maths differently, then you yourself need to experience it differently too. More than this, Tracy doesn&#x2019;t just make this need clear, but actively and compassionately empowers us to seek out ways to fill it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Somewhere inside you is a child who used to play with numbers, patterns and shapes. Reconnecting with your inner mathematician will improve your teaching and benefit your students, and it will also benefit you.&#x201d; &#x2014; Tracy Zager,&nbsp;<i>Becoming the Math Teacher You Wish You&#x2019;d Had,</i>&nbsp;p39<br> <br> Posted on&nbsp;May 10, 2017&nbsp;by&nbsp;David Butler</p><h2>Fantasmas (Ghosts) (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Catrina and her family are moving to the coast of Northern California because her little sister, Maya, is sick.

At runs and clubhouses, between rides and riots, Dobyns befriends bad-ass bikers, meth-fueled &#x201c;old ladies,&#x201d; gun fetishists, psycho-killer ex-cons, and even some of the &#x201c;Filthy Few&#x201d;--the elite of the Hells Angels who&#x2019;ve committed extreme violence on behalf of their club. Eventually, at parties staged behind heavily armed security, he meets legendary club members such as Chuck Zito, Johnny Angel, and the godfather of all bikers, Ralph &#x201c;Sonny&#x201d; Barger. To blend in with them, he gets full-arm ink; to win their respect, he vows to prove himself a stone-cold killer.<br><br> Hardest of all is leading a double life, which has him torn between his devotion to his wife and children, and his pledge to become the first federal agent ever to be &#x201c;fully patched&#x201d; into the Angels&#x2019; near-impregnable ranks. His act is so convincing that he comes within a hairsbreadth of losing himself. Eventually, he realizes that just as he&#x2019;s been infiltrating the Hells Angels, they&#x2019; ve been infiltrating him.

The bastard wastypically calm. Twelve months I&#x2019;d been his partner, in and out of harm&#x2019;sway, both together and alone, and the guy never looked stressed. Hewas as self- possessed as a rooster in a hen house&#x2014;my polar opposite.<br><br>I paced in front of him, rehearsing what I was going to tell our Hells Angels brothers. I shook the last smoke out of a pack of Newports. &#x201c;Shit.&#x201d; I lit the cigarette, crumpled the pack, and threw it to the ground. It was 10:00 a.m. and I&#x2019;d already emptied the first pack of the carton I&#x2019;d bought that morning.<br><br>Timmy said into his phone, &#x201c;I love you too honey cake. I should be home soon.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d been saying things like that going on five minutes. I stared at him and said, &#x201c;The fuck, stud? Come on.&#x201d; <br><br>Timmy put a finger in the air and continued on the phone. &#x201c;OK. Gotta run. Love you guys. OK. See you tonight.&#x201d; He snapped his phone closed. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the drama, Bird? We got this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you know. Nothing really.&#x201d; I pointed at the guy lying facedown at our feet. &#x201c;Just that if they don&#x2019;t buy it, then we&#x2019;ll end up like this asshole.&#x201d;<br><br>There, in a shallow desert ditch, was a gray- haired Caucasian male, his head split to the white meat. A pile of brains had oozed to the ground where Timmy had put Joby&#x2019;s .380. Blood droplets, sprayed into the sand and dirt, made small, dark constellations. His blue jeans were splattered with purple, quarter- sized splotches. His wrists and ankles were bound with duct tape, his hands were limp. It was already over 100 degrees and the promise of coagulated blood and exposed matter had begun to attract flies.<br><br>He wore a black leather jacket whose top rocker, that curved cloth patch that spanned the shoulder blades, read mongols.<br><br>I asked, &#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s dead?&#x201d;<br><br>Timmy said, &#x201c;Dude looks deader&#x2019;n disco. Shit, those look like his brains in the dirt.&#x201d; Timmy leaned in closer. &#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;d say he&#x2019;s pretty dead.&#x201d; He spat a stream of phlegm into the brush beyond the grave.<br><br>&#x201c;Dude, no fucking around here. We go home and show the boys we killed a Mongol, then we better be dead- nuts sure it doesn&#x2019;t look like he&#x2019;s coming back.&#x201d;<br><br>Timmy smiled. &#x201c;Relax, Bird, we got this. Like Lionel Richie said, we&#x2019;re easy like Sunday mornin&#x2019;.&#x201d; And then he started to sing. Badly:<br><br><i>Why in the world </i><br><i>would anybody put chains on me? </i><br><i>I&#x2019;ve paid my dues to make it. </i><br><i>Everybody wants me to be </i><br><i>what they want me to be. </i><br><i>I&#x2019;m not happy when I try to fake it! </i><br><i>Ooh, </i><br><i>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m easy. </i><br><i>Yeah. I&#x2019;m easy like Sunday mornin&#x2019;.</i><br><br>I smiled and said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, you&#x2019;re right. And even if you aren&#x2019;t, I don&#x2019;t see how it matters. We&#x2019;ve come too far.&#x201d;<br><br>He thought about that for a second. &#x201c;Yeah, we have.&#x201d;<br><br>We threw a couple shovels of dirt on our corpse and took some pictures. We relieved him of his Mongol jacket, stuffing it in a FedEx box. We got in the car and headed home, to Phoenix.<br><br>Timmy drove.

I said, &#x201c;He bit it. Pops&#x2019;s death should work to our advantage.&#x201d; <br><br>Timmy barely nodded. He was probably thinking about his wife and kids. Above all else, Timmy was decent. I looked past him. The asphalt and brown California pines, the late- afternoon grid of Phoenix, Arizona, moved beyond him like a sunset movie backdrop.<br><br>The next afternoon, JJ, Timmy, and I chowed at a Pizza Hut. We hadn&#x2019;t seen Bobby or any of the other boys yet. We wanted their tension to build.<br><br>JJ&#x2019;s phone rang. She looked at the ID, then at me. I shrugged, stuffed a pepperoni slice in my mouth, and nodded.<br><br>She flipped open. &#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; She grinned. &#x201c;Hi, Bobby. No, I haven&#x2019;t heard from him. You have? When? What&#x2019;d he say? He said <i>what?! </i>Bobby, what the fuck do you mean? Pops is&#x2014;<i>Pops is dead?</i>&#x201d; She lowered her voice and choked out the words with a frightened stutter. &#x201c;Bobby, you&#x2019;re scaring me! I don&#x2019;t <i>know</i> what the fuck&#x2019;s going on. All I know is a FedEx box came to the house this morning. It was sent from Nogales, Mexico.&#x201d; She pulled the phone away from her ear and placed a slice of roasted green pepper in her mouth. She sipped more iced tea. &#x201c;No way, Bobby! I&#x2019;m not opening shit. No. Forget it. Not until Bird gets back.&#x201d;<br><br>JJ&#x2019;s fear was convincing and effective. Our plan seemed to be working.<br><br>I leaned into the leather banquette. We weren&#x2019;t your average- looking cops&#x2014; we weren&#x2019;t even your average- looking undercover cops&#x2014; and we painted quite a picture. Timmy and I were bald, muscular, and covered in tattoos. JJ was cute, buxom, and focused. My eyes were blue and always lit up, Timmy&#x2019;s brown and wise, JJ&#x2019;s green and eager. Each of my long, bony fingers was armored with silver rings depicting things like skulls and talons and lightning bolts. My long, straggly goatee was haphazardly twisted into a ragged braid. JJ and I wore white wife- beater tank tops and Timmy wore a black, sleeveless T- shirt that said skull valley&#x2014;graveyard crew over the heart. I wore green camo cargo pants and flip- flops, and they wore jeans and riding boots. We each openly carried at least one firearm. Arizona&#x2019;s open- carry, so there you go.<br><br>JJ continued. &#x201c;No way, Bobby. I&#x2019;m not coming over there with the box. I&#x2019;m waiting till Bird gets home. All right. All right. Bye.&#x201d;<br><br>She hung up. She turned back to us and asked sarcastically, &#x201c;So, honey, when can I expect you?&#x201d;<br><br>I grinned and said, &#x201c;Any time, now. Any time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK! Can&#x2019;t wait!&#x201d;<br><br>We laughed and finished our lunch. We&#x2019;d been running ragged for months and were in the homestretch.

The four of them eat breakfast as a family, deal with teeth-brushing and backpacks, and Casey, who is the principal of the middle school in the same district as the elementary school Jack and Ian attend, drives the boys to drop-off. Kirsten then takes her shower in the newly quiet house before leaving for work.<br><br> The reality is that, at 6:17, as soon as Casey shuts the bathroom door, Kirsten grabs her own iPhone from her nightstand and looks at Lucy Headrick&#x2019;s Twitter feed. Clearly, Kirsten is not alone: Lucy has 3.1 million followers. (She follows a mere five hundred and thirty-three accounts, many of which belong to fellow-celebrities.) Almost all of Lucy&#x2019;s vast social-media empire, which of course is an extension of her life-style-brand empire (whatever the fuck a life-style brand is), drives Kirsten crazy. Its content is fake and pandering and boring and repetitive&#x2014;how many times will Lucy post variations on the same recipe for buttermilk biscuits?&#x2014;and Kirsten devours all of it, every day: Facebook and Instagram, Tumblr and Pinterest, the blog, the vlog, the TV show. Every night, Kirsten swears that she won&#x2019;t devote another minute to Lucy, and every day she squanders hours. The reason that things go wrong so early in the morning, she has realized, is this: she&#x2019;s pretty sure Twitter is the only place where real, actual Lucy is posting, Lucy whom Kirsten once knew. Lucy has insomnia, and, while all the other posts on all the other sites might be written by Lucy&#x2019;s minions, Kirsten is certain that it was Lucy herself who, at 1:22&nbsp;<i>a</i>.<i>m</i>., wrote, &#x201c;Watching Splash on cable, oops I forgot to name one of my daughters Madison!&#x201d; Or, at 3:14&nbsp;<i>a</i>.<i>m</i>., accompanied by a photo of an organic candy bar: &#x201c;Hmm could habit of eating chocolate in middle of night be part of reason I can&#x2019;t sleep LOL!&#x201d;<br><br> Morning, therefore, is when there&#x2019;s new, genuine Lucy sustenance. So how can Kirsten resist? And then the day is Lucy-contaminated already, and there&#x2019;s little incentive for Kirsten not to keep polluting it for the sixteen hours until she goes to bed with the bullshitty folksiness in Lucy&#x2019;s life: the acquisition of an Alpine goat, the canning of green beans, the baby shower that Lucy is planning for her young friend Jocelyn, who lives on a neighboring farm.<br><br> As it happens, Lucy has written (or &#x201c;written&#x201d;? Right? There&#x2019;s no way) a memoir, with recipes&#x2014;&#x201c;Dishin&#x2019; with the Prairie Wife&#x201d;&#x2014;that is being published today, so Kirsten&#x2019;s latest vow is that she&#x2019;ll buy the book (she tried to reserve it from the library and learned that she was three hundred and fifth in line), read it, and then be done with Lucy. Completely. Forever.<br><br> The memoir has been &#x201c;embargoed&#x201d;&#x2014;as if Lucy is, like, Henry Kissinger&#x2014;and, to promote it, Lucy travelled yesterday from her farm in Missouri to Los Angeles. (As she told Twitter, &#x201c;BUMMM-PEE flyin over the mountains!!&#x201d;) Today, she will appear on a hugely popular TV talk show on which she has been a guest more than once. Among last night&#x2019;s tweets, posted while Kirsten was sleeping, was the following: &#x201c;Omigosh you guys I&#x2019;m so nervous + excited for Mariana!!! Wonder what she will ask&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; The pseudo-nervousness, along with the &#x201c;Omigosh&#x201d;&#x2014;never &#x201c;Omigod,&#x201d; or even &#x201c;OMG&#x201d;&#x2014;galls Kirsten. Twenty years ago, Lucy swore like a normal person; but the Lucy of now, Kirsten thinks, resembles Casey, who, when their sons were younger, respectfully asked Kirsten to stop cursing in front of them. Indeed, the Lucy of now&#x2014;beloved by evangelicals, homeschooler of her three daughters, wife of a man she refers to as the Stud in Overalls, who is a deacon in their church&#x2014;uses such substitutes as &#x201c;Jiminy Crickets!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Fudge Nuggets!&#x201d; Once, while making a custard on-air, Lucy dropped a bit of eggshell into the mix and exclaimed, &#x201c;Shnookerdookies!&#x201d; Kirsten assumed that it was staged, or maybe not originally staged but definitely not edited out when it could have been. This made Kirsten feel such rage at Lucy that it was almost like lust.<br><br> Kirsten sees that, last night, Lucy, as she usually does, replied to a few dozen tweets sent to her by nobodies: Nicole in Seattle, who has thirty-one followers; Tara in Jacksonville, who&#x2019;s a mom of two awesome boys. (Aren&#x2019;t we all? Kirsten thinks.) Most of the fans&#x2019; tweets say some variation of &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so great!&#x201d; or &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my birthday pretty please wish me a happy birthday?!&#x201d; Most of Lucy&#x2019;s responses say some variation of &#x201c;Thank you for the kind words!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Happy Birthday!&#x201d; Kirsten has never tweeted at Lucy; in fact, Kirsten has never tweeted. Her Twitter handle is not her name but &#x201c;Minneap&#x201d; plus the last three digits of her Zip Code, and, instead of uploading a photo of herself, she&#x2019;s kept the generic egg avatar. She has three followers, all of whom appear to be bots.<br><br> Through the bathroom door, Kirsten can hear the shower running, and the minute that Casey turns it off&#x2014;by this point, Kirsten is, as she also does daily, reading an article about how smartphones are destroying people&#x2019;s ability to concentrate&#x2014;she springs from bed, flicking on light&nbsp;switches in the master bedroom, the hall, and the boys&#x2019; rooms. When Casey appears, wet hair combed, completely dressed, and finds Ian still under the covers and Kirsten standing by his bureau, Kirsten frowns and says that both boys seem really tired this morning. Casey nods sombrely, even though it&#x2019;s what Kirsten says every morning. Is Casey clueless, inordinately patient, or both?<br><br>At breakfast, Jack, who is six, asks, &#x201c;Do doctors ever get sick?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Casey says. &#x201c;Everyone gets sick.&#x201d;<br><br>While packing the boys&#x2019; lunches, Kirsten says to Ian, who is nine, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m giving you Oreos again today, but you need to eat your cucumber slices, and if they&#x2019;re still in your lunchbox when you come home you don&#x2019;t get Oreos tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>She kisses the three of them goodbye, and as soon as the door closes, even before she climbs the stairs, Kirsten knows that she&#x2019;s going to get herself off using the handheld showerhead. She doesn&#x2019;t consider getting herself off using the handheld showerhead morally problematic, but it presents two logistical complications, the first of which is that, the more often she does it, the more difficult it is for Casey to bring her to orgasm on the occasions when they&#x2019;re feeling ambitious enough to have sex. The second complication is that it makes her late for work. If Kirsten leaves the house at 7:45, she has a fifteen-minute drive; if she leaves at or after 7:55, the drive is twice as long. But, seriously, what else is she supposed to do with her Lucy rage?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>Previously excerpted from <i>The New Yorker</i>.

Dressed in her favorite puffy red coat, she was going to spend Hanukkah with her grandmother, who lived on the other side of the forest. Ruthie was bringing sour cream and applesauce to go along with the yummy latkes. She carefully packed her basket and kissed her mother good-bye. Snow began to fall. Soon Ruthie was lost in a thicket, and she was not alone. Someone was hiding behind the tree, and when he jumped out, Ruthie found herself face to face with a wolf. Ruthie will have to convince the wolf that eating latkes will be tastier than eating her!</p><p><b>Gloria Koster</b> is an elementary school librarian.

Little Red Ruthie is off to her grandmother's house to make latkes when she runs into a hungry wolf. Clever Ruthie convinces him not to eat her because she'll be much more filling after Hanukkah. "When the holiday is over, I am sure to be as round as a pancake myself...why not eat me then?" The wolf is momentarily deterred, but not for long. He winds up at Bubbe (grandmother) Basha's house where Ruthie prepares him plate after plate of latkes while relating the Hanukkah tale. Finally, the wolf is "full up to his eyeballs and very groggy, " and as he heads for the door, Bubbe Basha hands him a jelly donut, the final blow to his sore tummy. Humorous illustrations invigorate the predictable plot, as does the lively language.

From the Old Testament that anticipates him, to the Gospels that manifest him, to the Book of Acts that proclaims him, to the Epistles that explain him, and to the Book of Revelation that tells of him coming again, your Bible is about Jesus. That's why I love the vision of the <i>Christ-Centered Exposition Commentary</i> series.

Healthy boundaries preserve our integrity. Unlike defenses, which isolate us from our true selves and from those we love, boundaries filter out harm.<br> <br>This book provides the tools and insights needed to create boundaries so that we can allow time and energy for the things that matter&#x2014;and helps break down limiting defenses that stunt personal growth. Focusing on every facet of daily life&#x2014;from friendships and sexual relationships to dress and appearance to money, food, and psychotherapy&#x2014;Katherine presents case studies highlighting the ways in which individuals violate their own boundaries or let other people breach them. Using real-life examples, from self-sacrificing mothers to obsessive neat freaks, she offers specific advice on making choices that balance one&#x2019;s own needs with the needs of others.<br> <br>Boundaries are the unseen structures that support healthy, productive lives. <i>Where to Draw the Line</i> shows readers how to strengthen them and hold them in place every day.</p><p><b>Anne Katherine, M.A.</b>, is a certified mental health counselor, speaker, and the author of <i>Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin</i> and <i>Anatomy of a Food Addiction</i>. She lives near Seattle, Washington, where she leads programs for recovery and healing.<b>Chapter 1: What Are Boundaries?</b><br><br>Pause a moment. Stand on the earth and sense the spiral of your life. You have not come to this place by chance. All your choices have brought you here.<br><br>You created this life by the people you let in and the people you shut out, by giving your time to the quests that matter and by letting hours trickle toward lesser goals, through the pursuits to which you gave your energy, by the pressures to which you gave heed.<br><br>Every decision you've ever made, step by step, brought you to this pass. In short, your boundaries -- or your defenses -- created a corridor through which your life moved.<br><br>What is a boundary? A boundary is a limit that promotes integrity. At the most elemental level, your skin marks your physical limits. If it is ripped, the integrity of your body is threatened. Your cells hold their shape because a membrane contains them. Your nerves are sheathed. Your brain is protected by blood and bone.<br><br>Thousands of other boundaries might also be yours, protecting every treasured aspect of your life -- your relationships, your time, your home, the way you do things, your children, your priorities, your health, and your money. These boundaries are unseen, held in place by your decisions and actions.<br><br>A boundary is a limit. By the limits you set, you protect the integrity of your day, your energy and spirit, the health of your relationships, the pursuits of your heart. Each day is shaped by your choices. When you violate your own boundaries or let another violate them, stuffing spills out of your life.<br><br>A boundary is like a membrane that keeps an organism intact. It lets positive things through. It keeps harmful things out. In this way it operates quite differently from a defense, which indiscriminately keeps things out.<br><br>Boundaries provide a clear moral compass. They keep us on track. They protect the important, tender parts of ourselves.<br><br>Look at the parts of your life that work, that have integrity. This wholeness comes from the limits you have set to protect them.<br><br>Any part of your life that is not working can be improved by boundaries. Whether the organism is you, your body, your health, a friendship, your marriage, your work, or your energy, its integrity can be strengthened by boundaries.<br><br>This book is a boundary handbook. It can help you discover the walls that are missing as well as rules or customs that confine you to one place, preventing you from occupying the wider spaces. It will also expose defenses that you may have erected in place of healthy boundaries -- defenses that may do a lot of harm to you and your relationships.<br><br>We all make constant decisions about how to use this minute and that minute, whether to say yes or no to that request, whether to respond to a friend's need or rest a bit. It's the little decisions that can use up our lives, that can either support or sabotage our larger mission.<br><br>This book is about how to handle the daily demands of life in a way that protects your time and energy for the things that matter. It can help you to be clearer about what to include and what to leave out, so that you can fill the spaces of your life with the people, activities, and pursuits that are truly yours.<br><br>You are the only one who can change your life.<br><br>Copyright � 2000 by Anne Katherine, M.A.</p><h2>Doom Patrol Book One</h2><p>The groundbreaking series from Grant Morrison that led American comics in a wholly unexpected direction.<br><br> Originally conceived in the 1960s by the visionary team of writer Arnold Drake and artist Bruno Premiani, the Doom Patrol was reborn a generation later through Grant Morrison&#x2019;s singular imagination.<br><br> Though they are super-powered beings, and though their foes are bent on world domination, convention ends there.

Jones</strong> (DMin, Westminster Theological Seminary) serves as a biblical counseling professor at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. He is a certified biblical counselor, a Christian conciliator, an adjunct instructor, and a church reconciliation trainer with Peacemaker Ministries. Jones is the author of <em>Uprooting Anger</em> and has written numerous ministry booklets and articles.</p><p>&#x201c;Interpersonal conflict is a misery maker, stirring up chaos and the fog of war. Robert Jones carefully walks down the narrow road that makes peace and stirs up joy. His presentation is judicious, wide-ranging, balanced, biblical, and full of grace. Every counselor needs to know these things. Every struggler willing to take the time will benefit&#x2015;and we are all strugglers in these matters. Speed-reading not allowed! <em>Pursuing Peace</em> needs to be slowly absorbed and would make a marvelous twelve-week study.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>David Powlison,</strong>&nbsp;Late Executive Director, Christian Counseling &amp;&nbsp;Educational Foundation</p><p>&#x201c;Conflict comes in many shapes and sizes, so we need a variety of perspectives and insights into how to respond to it in biblically faithful ways. I am delighted that Robert Jones has brought his many years of pastoral and counseling experience to bear on this topic&#x2015;providing a fresh perspective on how to approach conflict and estranged people in a grace-filled, gospel-centered way.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ken Sande,</strong>&nbsp;President, Relational Wisdom 360; author,&nbsp;<em>The Peacemaker</em></p><p>&#x201c;In a day when &#x2018;us and them&#x2019; seems to be the default presumption with which our society confronts culture, politics, and religion, Robert Jones has provided us a scripturally sound and pragmatic path to follow to experience the peace for which most of us have a God-given desire. While the book may find itself in the syllabus of many Christian counseling classes, it is equally at home in the school of practical theology. Rich with biblical references and connected to practical application, <em>Pursuing Peace</em> will be helpful specifically for those dealing with issues of conflict in any arena of life, and generally for all who wish to gain a clearer understanding of how to interact with others in God-pleasing ways. With uncanny insights and sharp clarity, Dr. Jones addresses and then makes sense of normal, everyday conflicts and how they should be handled so that full resolution might be experienced. This book is indeed a helpful contribution to the culture of our day.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thom S. Rainer,</strong> President and CEO, LifeWay Christian Resources</p><p>&#x201c;Robert Jones has written a most profitable and sound book in <em>Pursuing Peace</em>. Though I wish it were not needed in the church today, the fact is that the message and advice of this book are desperately needed even among believers. I urge all of God&#x2019;s leaders in the household of faith not only to read this volume, but to discuss it as a guide for what to do the next time the peace of Christ&#x2019;s church is disturbed. Such reading and discussion will save loads of grief and some future headaches, as well as possible loss of the joy of the Lord.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Walter C.

When young adults talk about the problems they have with Christianity and the church, they often name certain attitudes and behaviors they believe are practiced too often by Christians: judging others, condemning people of other faiths, rejecting science, injecting politics into faith, and being anti-homosexual. With his familiar style, Adam Hamilton tackles these issues and addresses the how&#x2019;s and why&#x2019;s of Christians getting it right when it comes to being Christ in the world. Those who read <em>When Christians Get It Wrong</em> will gain a different way of understanding the issues that keep people away from Christianity and keep Christians from living a more compelling faith. Because, honestly, if we don&#x2019;t start getting it right, we may lose an entire generation.

Full-color illustrations reminiscent of prints by Ernst Haeckel help tide poolers with easy identification.</p><p>Marni Fylling has a B.S. in zoology from UC Davis and a graduate certificate in natural science illustration from UC Santa Cruz. A science illustrator, writer, and educator, her favorite thing to do is explore tide pools&#x2014;although sketching insects and wildflowers (or just about anything else) is a close second.</p><h2>House of Robots (House of Robots, 1)</h2><p><b>In this highly-illustrated series from James Patterson, an extraordinary robot signs up for an ordinary fifth grade class . . . and elementary school will never be the same!</b><br>It was never easy for Sammy Hayes-Rodriguez to fit in, so he's dreading the day when his genius mom insists he bring her newest invention to school: a walking, talking robot he calls E-for "Error". Sammy's no stranger to robots; his house is full of a colorful cast of them. But this one not only thinks it's Sammy's brother . . . it's actually even <i>nerdier</i> than Sammy. Will E be Sammy's one-way ticket to Loserville? Or will he prove to the world that it's cool to be square? It's a roller-coaster ride for Sammy to discover the amazing secret E holds that could change family forever . . . if all goes well on the trial run!<br></p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Since his first novel won the Edgar Award in 1977 James Patterson's books have sold more than 300 million copies. He is the author of the Alex Cross novels<b>,</b> the most popular detective series of the past twenty-five years, including <i>Kiss the Girls </i>and <i>Along Came a Spider</i>. He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Sammy Hayes-Rodriguez has never had an easy time fitting in at school. His mother is an inventor, his father is a graphic novel artist, and his beloved little sister has an immune condition that keeps her confined to the house. His best friend Trip has a talent for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. And then, there are the robots: a houseful of his mother's creations, programmed to do everything from housework to tutoring, plus some that don't do anything useful at all. When Sammy's mother insists that he take a robot named E to school with him, he knows that he's in for a record-breaking amount of teasing and trouble-and when E starts insisting that he is Sammy's brother, the situation goes from bad to worse. Sammy refuses to have anything to do with E at school, even when the robot's popularity starts to eclipse Sammy's and Trip's. But when E is kidnapped, Sammy realizes that he was starting to get fond of his robot brother, and he teams up with friends (both human and robot) to solve the mystery of E's disappearance. This light and funny story incorporates plenty of humor, both in the text and in the accompanying comic-style illustrations. Sammy's relationships with his parents, sister, and best friend are strong, if not particularly nuanced. A fast-moving plot, lots of jokes, and a host of weird robots will draw readers in, especially those looking for books similar to series such as "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" (Abrams/Amulet) and "Timmy Failure" (Candlewick).&#x2014;Misti Tidman, Licking County Library, Newark, OH</p><h2>Brew: Better Coffee At Home: Better Coffee At Home</h2><p>If you&#39;re on a first-name basis with your barista but haven&#39;t perfected (or even attempted) making caf�-quality coffee at home, let Brew show you the way.

A horrifying discovery. For over 20 years, Joanne Lee&#x2019;s mother kept the remains of not one, but three newborn babies hidden in a bin in her wardrobe.She had buried a fourth baby in newspaper and ragsin St Helens Cemetery.For the first time since exposing her mother&#x2019;s crimes, Joanne breaks her silence over her family&#x2019;s horrific ordeal and her fight for justice for the siblings she never knew. Growing up in chaotic circumstances on Merseyside, Joanne suffered at the hands of a violent boyfriend and controlling relatives, as her mother lapsed into a downward spiral of drinking and casual sex following the break-up of her marriage. But the consequences of her mother&#x2019;s messy lifestyle turned out to be far worse than Joanne could ever have imagined. She already knew of the baby buried in a shallow makeshift grave next to the family plot. But when Joanne came across a red plastic bin in her mother&#x2019;s wardrobe in 2009, she realised that the family home held an even more sinister secret. In Silent Sisters, the daughter who was falsely accused of murdering her own baby sister will tell her full story for the first time, detailing her struggle to understand her mother, to piece together the truth and to give the four babies the proper burial they deserve.</p><p>This is <b>Joanne Lee</b>&#x2019;s first book.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>A Woman Who Doesn&#39;t Quit - Bible Study Book: 5 Habits from the Book of Ruth</h2><p>Every woman will eventually face it: the temptation to give in and give up.

Until he was ten years old, Capote lived with distant relatives. This book is an autobiographical story of those years and his frank and fond memories of one of his cousins, Miss Sook Faulk. The text is illustrated with full color illustrations that add greatly to the story without distracting from Capote's poignant prose.First published in 1956, this much sought-after autobiographical recollection of Truman Capote's rural Alabama boyhood has become a modern-day classic. We are proud to be reprinting this warm and delicately illustrated edition of <i>A Christmas Memory</i>--"a tiny gem of a holiday story" (<i>School Library Journal</i>, starred review). Seven-year-old Buddy inaugurates the Christmas season by crying out to his cousin, Miss Sook Falk: "It's fruitcake weather!" Thus begins an unforgettable portrait of an odd but enduring friendship between two innocent souls--one young and one old--and the memories they share of beloved holiday rituals. <p><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p></p><h2>THE FANTASTIC FOUR OMNIBUS VOL. 1 [NEW PRINTING 2]</h2><p>They were visionaries.

Sure, the story is fairytale-like and presented in a jaunty, casually nonsensical way, but it is absolutely the stuff of nightmares. Lucy hears wolves hustling, bustling, crinkling, and crackling in the walls of the old house where her family lives, but no one believes her. Her mother says it's mice, her brother says bats, and her father says what everyone seems to say, "If the wolves come out of the walls, it's all over." Lucy remains convinced, as is her beloved pig-puppet, and her worst fears are confirmed when the wolves actually do come out of the walls.<p> Up to this point, McKean's illustrations are spectacular, sinister collages awash in golden sepia tones evocative of the creepy beauty in <i>The City of Lost Children</i>. The wolves explode into the story in scratchy pen-and-ink, all jaws and eyes. The family flees to the cold, moonlit garden, where they ponder their future. (Her brother suggests, for example, that they escape to outer space where there's "nothing but foozles and squossucks for billions of miles.") Lucy wants to live in her own house...and she wants the pig-puppet she left behind.</p><p> Eventually she talks her family into moving back into the once-wolfish walls, where they peek out at the wolves who are watching their television and spilling popcorn on slices of toast and jam, dashing up the stairs, and wearing their clothes. When the family can't stand it anymore, they burst forth from the walls, scaring the wolves, who shout, "And when the people come out of the walls, it's all over!" The wolves flee and everything goes back to normal...until the tidy ending when Lucy hears "a noise that sounded exactly like an elephant trying not to sneeze." Adult fans of this talented pair will revel in the quirky story and its darkly gorgeous, deliciously shadowy trappings, but the young or faint of heart, beware!

With no food, shelter, or supplies, the POWs were an army of dying men. As the Red Army advanced across Poland, the Nazi prison camps were liberated. In defiance of humanity, the freed Allied prisoners were discarded without aid. The Soviets viewed POWs as cowards, and regarded all refugees as potential spies or partisans. </p> <p> The United States repeatedly offered to help, but were refused. With relations between the Allies strained, a plan was conceived for an undercover rescue mission. In total secrecy, the OSS chose an obscure American air force detachment stationed at a Ukrainian airfield. The man they picked to undertake it was veteran 8th Air Force bomber pilot Captain Robert Trimble. </p> <p> With little covert training, Trimble took the mission. He would survive by wit, courage, and determination. This is the compelling, true story of an American hero who risked everything to bring his fellow soldiers home to safety and freedom. </p> <p> <strong>INCLUDES PHOTOS</strong> </p></p><p>During my childhood, my father mentioned nothing of his covert wartime experience. He was just a typical dad. In 2006 when he was 86 years old, I decided to ask him about his wartime exploits. He told me the stories I expected, about piloting heavy bombers over Germany. But then he slipped and mentioned his efforts in Russia, and a mission for the OSS. Suddenly he became someone I hardly knew. At first I was unsure what to make of it. Could this shocking tale be true? After his death, I began to look into his saga, and started in-depth research. During the following six years, supporting documentary evidence from the National Archives and the Air Force Historical Research Agency proved that Captain Trimble&#39;s story was true, changing the history of the Eastern Theater as we knew it."Snappy and Cinematic, <i>Beyond The Call</i> is a gift." - Adam Makos, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>A Higher Call</i></p><h2>John Prine - Guitar Songbook: 15 Songs Transcribed in Standard Notation &amp; Tab</h2><p>(Guitar Collection).

Based on author/illustrator Georgia Dunn&#x2019;s real-life pets, Elvis, Lupin, and Puck strap on neckties and pick up microphones to provide the most up-to-date relevant news stories (at least according to them).<br><br>Picking up where they last left off in <i>Breaking Cat News</i>, are Elvis, Puck, and Lupin reporting on the breaking news that matters to cats. Cynical, no-nonsense Elvis and shy, sweet, sensitive Puck are the reporter kitties in the field, while the adventurous jokester Lupin serves as anchor cat. Together, they're back to break headlines on mysterious man "tails,"&nbsp;all things holiday-related, new cat friends, and all the daily happenings in and outside their home.&nbsp;<br><br>The super fun "More to Explore" section includes how to draw the BCN news crew, how to draw expressions, how to draw your pet as a reporter, and paper dolls of the crew, along with props and extras!</p><p>In addition to being a syndicated cartoonist, Georgia Dunn is also a children&#x2019;s and fantasy/sci-fi illustrator.&nbsp; She sells her watercolor and ink illustrations on Etsy, in brick and mortar shops, and to educational magazines and independent publications.Gr 4-7-Dunn presents a second volume in the series that started as a webcomic about her own quirky felines. "News cats" Lupin, Elvis, and Puck each have a unique perspective on everyday life with their humans-Elvis with his no-nonsense determination to get to the bottom of every story, Puck with his tenacious coverage of foodie news, and Lupin as their adventurous (and sometimes destructive) home base anchor. Together they report on household news including cat-tree towers, bird magnets, new babies, holiday costumes, delicious smells, and even the "Gatos de Noticias" (the Spanish-speaking felines who live upstairs). As in the first series entry, Dunn includes many humorous one-page glimpses into the cats' lives, but this time, she doesn't simply rely on brief comic strip laughs; instead, longer arcs draw readers in emotionally. Children will worry when Elvis gets lost in the snow and smile when he finally befriends the tubby, gregarious cat Tommy. Not only do the charming watercolors deftly capture each cat's expressions, but they also add personal touches that convey their personalities perfectly. VERDICT Middle schoolers will fall in love with this book and beg for more, while cat fanciers of all ages will find plenty to enjoy.-Lara Goldstein, Orange County Public Libraries, NC&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

The contradiction seems glaringly obvious. How could a person who glamorizes greed, misogyny, and violence be religious or spiritual? We are all sitting there at home wondering, "How can the same person whose lifestyle and artistic expression emphasizes hatred, materialism, and raw intimidation, be standing there onstage wearing a diamond-encrusted crucifix?"</p><p>Actually, this phenomenon provides an important insight into the complexity of Black male spirituality. The disconnection between what this individual practices and what he preaches (or believes) is not difficult to recognize. But recognizing a man who, regardless of his flaws, yearns to experience the unconditional love that only a higher power can supply may be more challenging. The source of this apparent contradiction can be traced to the way in which many of us are first introduced to religion and spirituality.</p><p>We are encouraged to worship from early in our development. But few of us are introduced to the concept of character development as an expression of spirituality. Some of us have become so focused on our particular religion that we lose sight of achieving <i>spirituality</i>. Religion is the set of rituals and practices used to recognize, worship, and seek communion with God. Spirituality is the manifestation of this divine connection in one's daily life. Think of religion as the vehicle and spirituality the destination. The destination is the ability to see aspects of God in our lives and to exhibit this awareness as we interact with our environment.</p><p>Although it may be easy for us to detect the contradiction in what a musician on an awards show does and says, it is often difficult to recognize it in our own lives. I first became aware of my personal contradictions at age fifteen. I was a fiery, up-and-coming Black Nationalist who thought he could change the conditions of Black life by overpowering people with Black facts. Iremember recounting a ciphering (informal discussion) session that I had in the school cafeteria to one of my mentors. I was excited to explain to him how I had "blasted" all the brothers and sisters with my knowledge, and how stupid I made them look. He simply asked me, "What do we call each other?" I replied, "Brother and Sister." My mentor then asked me whether my actions seemed truly "brotherly." Without further discussion, I got the point. Just intellectualizing or articulating a concept wasn't enough. I also had to demonstrate it in my behavior. There it was staring me in the face: I was talking about being a "brother" but living out the life of a sarcastic smart-ass. It's not enough to talk the talk, you've got to walk the walk. From that point on I've used the same test as a measure for self-criticism and for my evaluation of society -- especially religion.</p><p>I was not raised in a religious household. Growing up between Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, my family attended church primarily on two occasions: funerals and Easter. Unfortunately I attended my fair share of funerals. During the 1980s, Los Angeles was becoming the gangbanging and drug-slinging capital of the world. I had a father, uncle, aunt, and cousins involved in street life and they exposed me to some of the worst that the world has to offer.</p><p>Having these people in my life helped me to understand how young entertainers could embrace a lifestyle reflecting hatred while simultaneously professing a love for God. My family members were neither monsters nor soulless, uncaring people. They may have been into the streets neck deep, but they still wanted to be loved unconditionally. The love they received from family members was conditional and usually peppered with destructive criticism. But even in the midst of a destructive lifestyle, they turned to God for unconditional love.</p><p>But even as brothers seek this divine unconditional love, they who experience all the ugliness in the world still have issues with God. This is why so many Black males are absent from the church. Numerous articles, books, and community forums are held to address this matter. Truth is, some of these brothers are angry with God. Some are wondering where God was when they suffered abuse as little boys, or when they were mistreated as teenagers, or even now, when they are dismissed as shiftless adults -- regardless of their personal struggles and/or successes. Others wonder where God was when they were being racially profiled by police, discriminated against in the workplace, or even when they found out their lover was cheating on them.</p><p>We know this anger exists because of the way Black men murder one another without a second thought, the way Black males abuse girls and women, and the way we self-medicate with everything from alcohol to codeine-laced cough syrup, marijuana, and crack. The anger is manifest in our perpetual petty beefs, our judgmental attitudes toward other Black men, and our inability to constructively resolve conflicts among one another. The anger expresses itself in various other ways, too. Some Black men echo our oppressors and accuse fellow Black males of using racism as a crutch. Some may have enduring patience with other people who abuse and mistreat them, but have a short fuse when dealing with our Black brothers. These same attitudes can be found in men whether they were raised as Christian, Muslim, Hebrew, Buddhist, Humanist, African Spiritualist, or something in between. Indeed, this spiritual crisis is not merely a reflection of their character, but also of the religions and spiritual systems and institutions that claim to offer solutions to their problems.</p><p>In my own search for balance and centeredness I have rounded the bases of the world's most popular religions. At age fourteen, I left home plate and headed for Christianity as first base, joining a nondenominational storefront church congregation after attending services with an aunt. Like most young Black men, I wanted to have a strong relationship with God. During the devotional part of the service it was made clear that unless "you know, that you know, that you know" that if you died that instant you were saved and on the path to heaven, you risked burning in the fires of hell for eternity by not joining the church. I was not certain, so I joined. I went to new members classes and participated in youth activities. But, ultimately I found the experience to be unfulfilling.</p><p>I loved the fellowship and the message of hope the church preached and, yes, the music was incredible. I found an emotional release in the midst of community worship, but the generic sermonizing about God's power, grace, and vengeance missed me for the most part. As much as the pastor attempted to make biblical stories relevant to our daily lives, I still felt like he was talking about a time and place far removed from the reality I faced every day. Some brothers have issues with the church because of politics or other philosophical differences; I was too young to make those connections. I rather longed for something that spoke directly to my struggle as a young Black male trying to define my manhood, my Blackness, and my relationship with God in a constructive way.</p><p>At age fifteen, I left the Christian church for second base, the Nation of Islam (NOI). It was not an immediate transition. I spent several months in a kind of spiritual limbo. My experience as a Muslim awakened my spirit and my mind -- not necessarily the theology of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and Minister Louis Farrakhan -- but with the social and political message of Black self-determination.By this time my mother had relocated us to San Antonio, Texas, in hopes of providing my younger brother and me with a safer environment. As already stated, inner-city Los Angeles in the late 1980s was a war zone and the casualties were predominantly young Black men.</p><p>I learned about the Nation via its weekly publication, <i>The Final Call</i>. Prior to reading excerpts of speeches by Minister Farrakhan, I had never heard a Black man mix politics, economics, sociology, and religion into such a digestible cocktail. I responded to the NOI because it was unapologetically Black. The Nation combats the identity issues that plague Black males by telling us that we are "the makers, the owners and cream of the planet earth," and moreover, that Allah (God) is Black and wants us to reclaim our legacy as rulers of the earth. The Fruit of Islam (FOI), the men of the NOI, are structured in a hierarchical quasi-military fashion that fulfills our yearning for belonging to a structured group. The selling of newspapers, bean pies, and other products places Black men in a constructive posture within the community. Not everyone likes bean pies, but whenever they see the young FOI approaching in a suit and bow tie, they nevertheless show respect.</p><p>Religiously, I practiced the prayers, attended the services and observed Ramadan (a Muslim time of fasting). The ministers who officiated the Sunday meetings used both the Bible and Qur'an. They made these texts speak to my circumstance by interweaving passages from scripture with Black history, interpretations of economic exploitation, and critiques of contemporary leadership for failing to empower the Black community. I remained an active, faithful Muslim into my freshman year of college.</p><p>A combination of forces moved me to the next base and separated me from the Nation of Islam. During the early 1990s, the NOI was going through some administrative and organizational restructuring. I was forced to choose sides: whether to stay with the minister who introduced me to the teachings of the Honorable Elijah...</p></p><h2>Christopher Columbus (Step into Reading)</h2><p>Independent readers can learn about Columbus&#39;s fateful voyage in this dramatic, easy-to-read account of a pivotal moment in American history.</p><p>Illus. in full color.

Her interest in natural history began at an extremely early age, as she became passionately interested in first butterflies and then birds. The daughter of two librarians, one of whom later became a secondhand bookseller, Marianne was as bookish as she was bird-obsessed. She worked for seven years in natural history publishing, first for bird book publisher Christopher Helm, and later for <em>Birdwatch</em> magazine. Her particular interest in owls and other birds of prey was fueled by a brief but unforgettable adventure in 2005, when she joined bird ringers studying Ural, Tengmalm&#x2019;s, and Eagle owls in the forests of Sweden. She began a new career as a writer in 2007, and since then has written more than a dozen books for adults and children on a range of natural history subjects.

He is also the founder and host of <i>Side Hustle School</i>, a daily podcast with&nbsp;more than 2 million downloads per month.&nbsp;During a lifetime of self-employment and side hustling, he visited every country in the world (193 in total) before his 35th birthday.<p>The Way of the Hustle</p><p>When a British man who managed a construction company wrote a series of fish tank reviews for an obscure website, he included links to several Amazon product listings at the end of the reviews. He knew he&#x2019;d earn a small commission if visitors clicked through from the reviews and made a purchase, but he was so busy with his day job that after he posted the reviews, he promptly forgot about the whole thing. A few weeks later, a check arrived in the mail . . . for $350. His partner didn&#x2019;t believe it was real money until he took her out to a nice dinner with the proceeds.</p><p>At the time, he had no idea that this small project, created in a weekend, would go on to make hundreds of dollars. He also didn&#x2019;t know that several years later those same reviews would still be earning him an average of $700 a month, without any further work on his part. It wasn&#x2019;t retirement money, but it sure was nice.</p><p>Similarly, when a San Diego government employee offered to photograph a friend&#x2019;s wedding, he didn&#x2019;t know it would lead to an extra $3,500 every month. This employee didn&#x2019;t want to be a full-time wedding photographer, but the option to shoot an occasional wedding whenever he wants provides him with security and savings. He takes the jobs that accommodate his schedule and turns down the ones that don&#x2019;t, all while continuing to receive a steady paycheck from his &#x201c;real&#x201d; job.</p><p>When a Pennsylvania oil and gas sales rep started posting images on Pinterest, she wasn&#x2019;t a celebrity and didn&#x2019;t have a &#x201c;revenue model.&#x201d; In addition to the day job, she was also a mom and a yoga teacher and active in her local community. Within a month, she had earned more than $1,000--much to her shock and happy surprise. After three years, she&#x2019;d taken in more than $40,000, all while uploading photos whenever she had a break from her busy day.</p><p>These stories, all true, represent the way of the side hustle: defined as a moneymaking project you start on the side, usually while still working a day job. In other words, it&#x2019;s a way to create additional income without taking on the risks of going full throttle into the world of working for yourself.</p><p>Sure, for some people the thought of quitting their day job and striking out on their own is exhilarating. For many others, however, it can be terrifying. After all, whether or not you have a family to support or a mortgage to pay, a job that produces a steady income and provides health insurance is difficult, if not impossible, to give up.</p><p>But what if you could get a profitable idea off the ground with just a minimal investment of time, money, and effort--and you could make that happen alongside your stable and steady job? This book shows you how to do exactly that, with a step-by-step guide that takes you from idea to implementation in just twenty-seven days. The guide is designed for the busy and impatient. It&#x2019;s a detailed road map that will allow you to brainstorm, select, launch, and make money in under a month.</p><p>But a side hustle isn&#x2019;t just about putting extra cash in your pocket. In today&#x2019;s environment, where the idea of a business having any sense of loyalty to its workers has all but disappeared, the side hustle is the new job security. It affords you the ability to decide. When you receive multiple paychecks from different sources, you are no longer dependent on the whims of a single employer.</p><p>More income means more options. More options mean more freedom.</p><p>In the pages ahead you&#x2019;ll read many more stories like the ones mentioned above. Entertaining as they are, they also have a greater purpose. They&#x2019;re here to show you that anyone can build a fast track to freedom by increasing their income--using the skills they already have. No matter what it is you do in your day job, or whether you want to identify as an &#x201c;entrepreneur&#x201d; or not, you need a side hustle. If you follow this plan, you&#x2019;ll have one in less than a month.</p><p>What will your story be?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Money Tree</p><p>Did you ever hear the saying that money doesn&#x2019;t grow on trees? Parents sometimes say this to their kids when the kids want to buy everything in sight. These parents are only half right. Money does grow on trees--you just have to plant the right seeds, in the right soil. In each short chapter of this book, you&#x2019;ll read a story of someone who found a money tree and made it blossom--simply by putting an idea into action. Along the way, you&#x2019;ll learn how to uncover and unlock a replicable process you can tailor to your own hustle.</p><p>I hope you find these stories inspiring, but more than that I hope they inspire you to take action. There&#x2019;s a money tree out there waiting for you, too. In the next twenty-seven days, you&#x2019;ll learn how to find and nurture it, and then watch it grow.</p><p>Whether you&#x2019;re no stranger to side hustles or you&#x2019;re brand-new to the concept, this book will help you get up and running with a profitable project in a short period of time. All the details are in the next 250 pages, but here&#x2019;s what you need to know right now:</p><p>1. Everyone should have a side hustle. Even if you love your job, having more than one source of income will give you more freedom and more options.</p><p>2. It&#x2019;s not that hard to start one. You can do so in less than a month by following the lessons in this book.</p><p>3. To be successful at hustling, you first need to understand how to generate profitable ideas and then choose which one is best at any particular time. You&#x2019;ll learn both of these skills in the first half of the book.</p><p>4. Side hustles are all about action! You need to launch your idea, usually before you feel totally ready, then regroup and refine after seeing the initial results. You&#x2019;ll learn how to do this in the second half of the book.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What You Need and What You Don&#x2019;t</p><p>There are very few prerequisites to side hustling. To be successful in using this model, mostly you need:</p><p>� The right frame of mind.</p><p>Specifically, you need a willingness to learn and experiment. Even if you&#x2019;re a longtime serial hustler, some of what you&#x2019;ll learn here will be new to you. To get the most out of these lessons, you&#x2019;ll need to be willing to open your mind to a different way of thinking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>� The willingness to act.</p><p>Even though I&#x2019;ve tried to write a very practical book, merely reading it won&#x2019;t do much for you. You must be willing to follow the instructions and attempt the exercises. Modifying them is fine--they have to work for you--but if you want to be successful, you can&#x2019;t skip them entirely.</p><p>As you can see, the list of prerequisites is pretty basic. The list of what you do not need is far longer. This is important, because many people think that the ability to earn money outside of their day job is out of their reach. Luckily, these people are wrong. Let&#x2019;s get this out of the way right from the start:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>� You don&#x2019;t need much money.</p><p>Put away your credit cards (at least the ones with high limits) and don&#x2019;t worry about needing to raise capital or ask someone for a loan. The process I&#x2019;ll show you in the days ahead, along with the vast majority of ideas and stories you&#x2019;ll read about, do not require a large amount of money--and in some cases, no money at all is required.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>� You don&#x2019;t need much time.</p><p>To be fair, you&#x2019;ll need some time. But the time required to start a hustle should be minimal. The twenty-seven-day plan is designed to be doable alongside your existing commitments and take no more than one hour a day. If you want to work faster, or build your project to a higher level right away, that&#x2019;s fine and you can spend more time doing so--but you won&#x2019;t have to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>� You don&#x2019;t need a business degree, or any kind of specialized education.</p><p>Most business education teaches people how to be a corporate manager, which is fine if that&#x2019;s what you do for your day job. But with a side hustle, you&#x2019;re starting your own business, not running someone else&#x2019;s. You don&#x2019;t need an MBA. You won&#x2019;t have to use complicated software or spreadsheets. Your financial forecasts can be written on the back of a napkin--and in fact, that&#x2019;s exactly what you&#x2019;ll learn to do on Day 5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>� You don&#x2019;t need employees, assistants, or business partners.</p><p>You may want to get help at some point, but not right away. The initial goal is to start on your own, using your own skills and effort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>� You don&#x2019;t need experience starting a business.</p><p>You don&#x2019;t need to be an &#x201c;entrepreneur&#x201d; to start a side hustle. Even if you have zero experience working for yourself, with the advice in this book and a little resourcefulness of your own, you&#x2019;ll have no problem taking your hustle from idea to profit.</p><p>In fact, some of these things (the money, the abundance of free time, even education) can actually be detrimental to your plan. If you have money to spend, you&#x2019;ll spend it. If you have an abundance of free time to waste, you&#x2019;ll waste it. Whatever you learned about business in school can sidetrack or prevent you from taking the simple steps you need to turn your idea into action. Last, at some point it may be wise to expand your team, but when you have to do everything yourself, you&#x2019;ll have to stick to what&#x2019;s essential. This plan will show you how.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why I Wrote This Book</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been starting and operating side hustles my entire adult life. In fact, it&#x2019;s the only occupational path I&#x2019;ve ever known. For more than twenty years, I&#x2019;ve made a good living doing everything from importing coffee to building websites. Somewhere in that time, I also spent several years as an aid worker in West Africa, then pursued (and finished) a quest to visit every country in the world. If you asked me how to be a better employee, I wouldn&#x2019;t know what to tell you. But if you want to know how to create a new source of income, I can guide you each step of the way.</p><p>You can learn the way of the hustle, too. Once you acquire the skill of idea generation, you&#x2019;ll have no problem coming up with ideas whenever you need. Then, when you master the skill of making ideas happen, you&#x2019;ll be able to convert those ideas into income-producing assets.</p><p>It&#x2019;s like alchemy, except it&#x2019;s not magical. It&#x2019;s practical.</p><p>The sole purpose of this book is to help you increase your income and your security, giving you more options and allowing you to do more of what you want. If you accept this mission and commit to seeing it through, I promise to do everything I can to support you along the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How to Use the 27-Day Plan&nbsp;</p><p>Side hustle skills are not taught in school. Unless you were especially fortunate, you probably didn&#x2019;t learn them from your parents, either. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with classroom knowledge, but it won&#x2019;t help you much here. The only way to master side hustle skills is by doing.</p><p>The other day I talked with someone who was in the process of starting her first hustle. She&#x2019;s a classic example of whom this book is written for. She has a good job and doesn&#x2019;t necessarily want to strike off on her own--but she also wanted to build something for herself outside her daytime work hours. In this case, her idea was to create a pop-up art show to sell her illustrations. Since she didn&#x2019;t know much about starting a business, she pursued what seemed like a normal course of action and signed up for an eight-week entrepreneurship class at a local college. Unfortunately, the class led mostly to frustration. &#x201c;About 15 percent of what I learned was helpful,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;But the rest was about things that were either mostly or completely irrelevant to my goals.&#x201d;</p><p>Consider this book to be a different kind of school. Instead of teaching you to write lengthy business plans and borrow money, it will show you a complete process of planning and action, condensed into a twenty-seven-day timeline.</p><p>And instead of showing up for class at a prescribed hour every day, you can learn these lessons on your own schedule, and on your own time. Nevertheless, you&#x2019;ll want to follow the general outline below, which shows how all the steps build together to bring you to a profitable hustle.</p><p>Each week focuses on a theme and is divided into five steps, with bonus steps in Weeks 3 and 4. Don&#x2019;t get hung up over how long any particular step takes you--some can be quickly completed, and some may take you longer than an actual day. The key point is to move through these stages in sequence.</p><p>Here are the objectives for each week:</p><p>Week 1: Learn to generate profitable ideas</p><p>Week 2: Select your best idea (not all ideas are created equal!)</p><p>Week 3: Prepare to share your best idea with the right group of people</p><p>Week 4: Launch--probably before you&#x2019;re ready--and track your results</p><p>Week 5: Regroup and refine</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your Turn: Let&#x2019;s Get to Work!&nbsp;</p><p>By now you should have an idea of whether the hustling life is right for you or not. Here&#x2019;s a quick test:</p><p>� Do you like the idea of having more than one source of income?</p><p>� Are you willing to devote at least thirty minutes a day to building your hustle, for at least the next twenty-seven days?</p><p>If you answered &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; to those two questions, this plan is for you. Just one warning: Throughout the book, I&#x2019;m going to be fairly direct in showing you what to do. I&#x2019;ve hustled for more than twenty years, and I&#x2019;ve worked with thousands of people starting their first hustle. I know what works and what doesn&#x2019;t. I want you to succeed, and I don&#x2019;t want to waste your time. Trust the process.<br><br></p><p>Track Your Progress: Free Tools</p><p>Last, while everything you need to succeed is in these pages, I&#x2019;ve created some additional tools for those who want a little extra help in going through the model. The first is a free task-tracker to help you keep up with your progress. Sometimes it helps to have a visual reminder of how you&#x2019;re doing. Second is an online community where side hustlers like you can join up with other people who are all undertaking the challenge. You don&#x2019;t have to do this with a group, but many people find it beneficial.</p></p><h2>When I Was a Slave: Memoirs from the Slave Narrative Collection (Dover Thrift Editions: Black History)</h2><p><p>In an effort to provide unemployed writers with work during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the United States Government, through the Works Progress Administration (WPA), funded the Federal Writers' Project. One of the group's most noteworthy and enduring achievements was the Slave Narrative Collection, consisting of more than 2,000 transcripts of interviews with former slaves, who, in blunt, simple words, provided often-startling first-person accounts of their lives in bondage. This book reprints some of the most detailed and engrossing life histories in the collection. Each narrative is complete.<br>Thirty-four gripping testimonies are included, with all slave occupations represented &#x2014; from field hand and cook to French tutor and seamstress. Personal treatment reported by these individuals also encompassed a wide range &#x2014; from the most harsh and exploitative to living and working conditions that were intimate and benevolent.<br>An illuminating and unique source of information about life in the South before, during, and after the Civil War, these memoirs, most importantly, preserve the opinions and perspective of those who were enslaved. Invaluable to students, teachers, and specialists in Southern history, this compelling book will intrigue anyone interested in the African-American experience.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Passover Haggadah [Large Print Edition]</h2><p>**************<br>Please note that the negative reviews are because a seller photocopied the haggadah and reproduced it.

Chock full of wildly eccentric and deliciously criminal characters&#x2014;including a psycho enforcer with a green thumb, a Bahamian bad man, and the beautiful, unabashedly greedy psychic Reverend Dawn&#x2014;<em>Riding the Rap</em> dazzles with Leonard&#x2019;s trademark ingenious plot turns and razor-keen dialogue. Gripping, surprising, and unforgettable, it is a crime fiction gem that any thriller writer&#x2014;from past masters John D. MacDonald, Dashiell Hammett, and James M. Cain to the bestselling mystery auteurs of today&#x2014;would be thrilled to call his own.<br></p></p><p>In this sequel to <i>Pronto</i>, Harry Arno has retired from bookmaking but is still closing out some of his outstanding debts. But then his collection agent, an ex-con by the name of Bobby Deo, goes to pick up $1,800 from Chip Ganz and ends up getting hired for a hostage-taking operation (like kidnapping "in a way," Chip tells him, "only different. A lot different.") When Harry's taken by his own man, it's up to United States Marshal Raylan Givens to track him down, in the same methodically relentless fashion he tracked Harry that time he ran off to Italy. Throw in a henchman named Louis Lewis with plans of his own and an attractive young psychic named Reverend Dawn, and you've got yet another crime story that'll keep you on the edge of your seat--occasionally chuckling to yourself--straight through to the finish. (And bonus points to loyal Leonard fans who can spot the crossover elements from <i>Rum Punch</i> and <i>Maximum Bob</i>.) <i>--Ron Hogan</i>"<i>Riding the Rap</i> made me feel like a kid again.

Levy MD, JD</p><p>Infected teeth, infected gums, infected tonsils, and even infected sinuses always cause enough discomfort to drive us to a physician or dentist, but none of these are life-threatening... right? Wrong! In fact, dead wrong! They often kill, and they typically do it in a silent fashion. The overwhelming evidence in <em>Hidden Epidemic </em>proves that these oral infections are responsible for <em>most heart attacks and breast cancers</em>, as well as a majority of other chronic degenerative diseases. And even more alarming is the fact that when these oral infections are asymptomatic (&#x201c;silent&#x201d;), which is usually the case, they are frequently even more deadly than when they hurt!</p><p>New diagnostic tools, such as 3D Cone Beam Imaging, a relatively new diagnostic X-ray tool, reveals many of these pools of infection to a degree never before possible with regular X-ray examinations. Studies with this technology indicate that the prevalence of these oral pathologies is very common throughout the world. The good news is that there are effective treatments for these infections that are very inexpensive &#x2014; especially when compared to the costs of treating the degenerative diseases they seed and feed. <em>Hidden Epidemic </em>is an invaluable resource for lay people, physicians, and dentists who want a clear path away from the pain, suffering, and death associated with silent oral infections.</p></p><p>Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD is a board-certified cardiologist and a lawyer. He is the author of 10 other groundbreaking medical books, including Curing the Incurable: Vitamin C, Infectious Diseases, and Toxins, Primal Panacea, and Death by Calcium. He is one of the leading vitamin C experts in the world, and he frequently lectures at medical conferences and to groups of people around the globe about the proper role of vitamin C and other antioxidants in optimizing treatment protocols for the most common chronic degenerative diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and advanced chronic infections, such as Lyme.</p><h2>Katt vs. Dogg</h2><p><b>For anyone who loves cats, dogs (or both!), James Patterson's most <i>pawsome</i> story ever is set in a society defined by the oldest rivalry in the world: katts versus doggs! </b><br>Oscar is a happy dogg---a rambunctious kid who loves being a Dogg Scout.

Drawing on his vivid memories of battle and detailed diaries, Patton dramatically recounts his celebrated Third Army&#39;s sweeping campaign across Western Europe right up to the final Allied casualty report. The result is a remarkable frontline view of daily strategies and heroic drivesincluding the rescue of the Battle of the Bulge from Allied infamy and the triumphant Palatinate Campaign - revealing a fascinating portrait of the full-of-vinegar, controversial commander.

Soon Little Acorn grew into Little Oak. But now what was he to do? He couldn't grow oranges like the orange tree or flowers like the rose bush. He just grew and grew until he became Big Oak, and his branches were big and strong-but still he didn't know what he was to do. Then one day Big Oak found that his strong branches were just right for a very special purpose. <em>The Oak Inside the Acorn</em> is the story of the miracle inside each of us. For within every child is the special person God created, just waiting to grow.</p></p><p><p>Since entering the ministry in 1978, Max Lucado has served churches in Miami, Florida; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and San Antonio, Texas.

Soft music plays as Little Acorns stem breaks away from his mothers branch, and he tumbles into a farmers truck filled with orange trees passing underneath. His mothers parting words--grow and become all you can be--linger long after her leaf-filled branches disappear in the distance. Sounds of a braking truck and shovels send Little Acorn spinning into the soft dirt beside a recently transplanted orange tree, and this engaging story of what develops begins. Larkins delivery, especially his timing, enhance a tale that children will ask to hear repeatedly.

While some elements of the elegant design and illustrations are a bit retro, the volume contains a wealth of up-to-date information and facts about habitats and species. Each chartlike page displays some aspect of nature, from the many varieties of feathers or leaf shapes to the ecosystems of the Arctic and rain forest. The slipcover folds out into a wall poster of birds, insects, and migrators, and three colors of ribbon bookmarks emerge from the binding to facilitate navigation. Color-coded arrows visually refer readers to other pages on related subjects. The digitally created illustrations resemble traditional media with a subtle, sophisticated palette, adding to the symbiosis of old and new design techniques. The index lists species names but not some of the concepts mentioned, such as photosynthesis or camouflage. There is a chart devoted to skeletons and skulls yet neither word appears in the index.

After twelve years in the French army and eleven as a policeman, he had seen the gruesome effects of artillery shells and machine guns and then of the metal and glass of automobile crashes on the human body. And while he often hoped to forget the impact of a bullet on his own flesh, the sullen ache in his hip with the coming of each winter&#x2019;s damp would remind him of the shot that had sent him tumbling into the snow in the hills above Sarajevo. He&#x2019;d never forget the brightness of the French tricolore on the sleeve of the medic who worked on him until the helicopter came. Any sight of his country&#x2019;s flag now always brought back to Bruno the red of his blood against the white of the snow and the blue helmet he&#x2019;d been wearing as a United Nations peacekeeper.<br><br>But Bruno had never seen anything quite as grim as the sight of the dead man now lying trussed and half-�naked before him. Rain trickled down the corpse&#x2019;s chest and stomach, gleaming on the fresh burn marks where the stubs of his nipples had been. The body was lit by the headlights of Bruno&#x2019;s own van and the large fire engine of St. Denis. Flickering flames on the tires of the car defied the steady rain and the white foam the firemen had used to douse the fire. Breathing through his mouth to avoid the stench of both charred flesh and burning rubber, Bruno checked his watch. Dawn was still an hour away.<br><br>It was not only the smell that turned his stomach. He felt sickened by a personal sense of outrage. Even though the dead man was a stranger, Bruno felt the manner of this man&#x2019;s death had been a kind of pollution of these woods that he loved and knew so well. He&#x2019;d never be able to bring his horse or his dog this way without thinking of it. And this atrocity had been carried out by people skilled in the blackest arts of death, professionals who were notoriously hard to bring to justice. But he&#x2019;d find them.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s certainly dead and it&#x2019;s obviously murder. Did you see the wound under the chin?&#x201d; asked Fabiola, whose presence as a doctor was legally required to certify death. Bruno nodded. A stiletto up through the soft skin of the mouth and straight into the brain killed quickly and with very little blood. It was one of the assassin&#x2019;s tricks taught to troops in special forces.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even give you an approximate time of death,&#x201d; she went on. Bruno&#x2019;s good friend Fabiola wore no hat, and rain had plastered streaks of her dark hair across her face, covering the scar on her left cheek. Without makeup her face was pale in the headlights and her eyes enormous. Bruno was suddenly struck by how beautiful Fabiola could be.<br><br>&#x201c;Normally I&#x2019;d use an anal thermometer for body temperature, but he&#x2019;s been badly sodomized and then the fire . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The ground is dry beneath his hips,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;The storm broke just after two this morning, so presumably the killers chained him to the tree before then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were awake for the storm?&#x201d; she asked. He nodded. The lightning had not disturbed him but the quick scuttle of Balzac, his basset hound, into his bed had jolted him awake just as the thunder came. Usually barred from his master&#x2019;s bed, the dog was still young enough to be granted a dispensation during the tempests that occasionally gave this valley of the River V�z�re a brief taste of an Indian monsoon. Bruno had risen, gone to the window and looked out to see if the rain was hard enough to damage the vineyards now that the harvest was due.<br><br>After a lapse into a steady drizzle, the rain was coming harder again, the tail end of a storm front that had swept in from the Atlantic. Once Fabiola had finished her examination, Bruno tried to cover the body with a plastic sheet. It protected the charred bones of the feet and lower legs but didn&#x2019;t stretch as far as the man&#x2019;s wrists, still handcuffed around the trunk of a young chestnut tree. The poor devil would have to stay that way, arms stretched out behind his head, his legs staked apart and his back arched like some medieval torture victim, until the forensics team arrived from P�rigueux with its cameras and checklists.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think he was killed before the fire burned his feet away?&#x201d; Fabiola&#x2019;s voice sounded forced as she tried to control it.<br><br>Bruno shrugged, a gesture that turned into a shudder as he thought about it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s more your expertise than mine. I don&#x2019;t know how you&#x2019;d tell.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The autopsy will confirm it. After death the heart stops pumping blood.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno suspected the feet had been burned deliberately before the car was set on fire. The blaze might have scorched the legs but it could hardly have devoured them. He guessed the killers had poured gasoline onto his feet.<br><br>The only time Bruno had heard of that being done was in the Algerian War. It was a cruel joke of the rebels, who called the white colonists on their land the pieds-�noirs, the &#x201c;black feet,&#x201d; after the black boots the French troops had worn when they first conquered the country in 1830. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll give you black feet,&#x201d; they taunted the French prisoners as they poured the gasoline. He&#x2019;d been told that by Hercule, an old friend, now dead, who had served in the vicious conflict France had fought in vain to keep Algeria and its oil.<br><br>&#x201c;No identification?&#x201d; Fabiola asked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say North African heritage with that hair and the olive skin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He has nothing on him, and the registration plates were removed from the car.&#x201d; Bruno had taken the vehicle identification number from the engine block, but he didn&#x2019;t expect any feedback until much later in the day. Fabiola was staring at him, expecting him to say more. &#x201c;All we know is that Serge was getting up for the cows and saw the explosion in the woods. He called the pompiers just after four. You might as well go back to bed, since I&#x2019;m stuck here until the forensics team arrives.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno yawned and stretched. It had been a broken night, his phone ringing with its special emergency tone waking him before midnight. Then he had dozed, expecting to be called again, until the storm had woken his dog. He&#x2019;d dozed again, Balzac tucked in against his shoulder, until Albert had called him to report the fire in the woods. At least the storm had stopped it from spreading. Like most of the rest of southern France, the d�partement had recently issued a forest fire alert after the dry summer.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s too late to go back to bed, and I wouldn&#x2019;t sleep, not thinking about this.&#x201d; Fabiola gestured with her chin at the plastic-�covered corpse. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go back and shower and put some coffee on. Feel free to come and have a cup once you can get away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, but it won&#x2019;t be for a while. I might have to leave the horses to you this morning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Poor Bruno. Nobody should have to see scenes like this. If you need something to help you sleep . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled his thanks but shook his head. It was thoughts about women and his confused love life that kept him awake some nights, not memories of war and corpses. Fabiola quickly kissed his cheek and then briefly took shelter with the pompiers in the cab of the fire engine to sign the certificate of death before heading home.<br><br>The burned-�out car was on a rough gravel path about a hundred meters from a minor road, just at the entrance to the commune&#x2019;s old garbage dump. It had been closed since the building of the modern d�chetterie, where all refuse had to be sorted into different containers. The dead man lay a few meters from his charred vehicle. The car had been stopped just beyond the entrance to the dump, beside a pile of logs. Bruno raised one end of the topmost log to assess its weight; it was at least fifty kilos. He could lift it, but he couldn&#x2019;t carry it far.<br><br>Four charred logs lay on the gravel path behind and beneath the burned-�out car. Bruno guessed the driver had been lured onto this side road and then found himself unable to reverse because somebody pretty strong had been waiting to toss thick logs behind his wheels. But why had the driver stopped? Bruno walked on up the slope and around a sharp bend, and his flashlight picked out some broken twigs and crushed grass. He saw tire tracks; a second car had been parked here, blocking the way. It could have been waiting, its driver then switching on the headlights to force the oncoming car to stop. Then an accomplice could have used the logs to immobilize it. He&#x2019;d be looking for at least two men, and forensics might get something from the tracks.<br><br>The spread between those marks looked too wide for a car. He went back to his vehicle for a metallic tape measure and recorded a width of one meter thirty in his notebook. He&#x2019;d have to check this against the width of various types of truck when he got back to his office.<br><br>He loosened the hood of his anorak to make room by his ear for his phone and punched in the speed-�dial number for the brigadier, an important official from the Ministry of the Interior who had given him the phone during a previous case. It was supposed to be secure from wiretaps and it rang with a special tone when someone else on the brigadier&#x2019;s private network was calling. That had been the tone that had woken him before midnight. The caller had identified himself only as Rafiq and said he was coming onto Bruno&#x2019;s territory and might need support. He&#x2019;d said he would call again, but hadn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;Duty officer,&#x201d; came the voice in Bruno&#x2019;s ear. Bruno identified himself, described the call from Rafiq and reported the death and the evidence of ambush and torture. &#x201c;It may be Rafiq,&#x201d; he said, stooping to protect his notebook from the rain and read out the vehicle identification number. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s Rafiq&#x2019;s car there&#x2019;s no sign of his phone. It could be compromised.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll check and call you back.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno began to give his location and was interrupted.<br><br>&#x201c;We know where you are. With that phone your GPS coordinates come up on my screen. Have any other police officers been alerted?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Commissaire Jalipeau, chief detective for the d�partement,&#x201d; Bruno said. He had pondered calling the gendarmes, but J-J&#x2019;s team had the expertise and the forensics lab. And the call from Rafiq on the special line had made him cautious. Bruno, employed by the town of St. Denis, got on well with the local gendarmes, but J-J, like many detectives of the Police Nationale, tended to see them mainly as traffic cops.<br><br>&#x201c;Good, keep it that way.&#x201d; The duty officer ended the call.<br><br>Bruno trudged back through sodden leaves toward the fire engine. Fabiola&#x2019;s car was already gone, but the pompiers were happy to stay, warm and dry in their cab and drinking coffee from a thermos. Bruno was just finishing the cup they gave him when his phone rang again.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me,&#x201d; came the voice of J-J. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just coming into St. Denis. Can you guide us to the place? I can&#x2019;t make this damn GPS work and I don&#x2019;t want to have to ask the gendarmes.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno gave directions and told him to watch for the lights of the fire engine. He went to tell the pompiers they could go home soon, that the police were on their way. Would French policing be any more efficient if they were all one service, he wondered, or at least if they could overcome the traditional rivalries and learn to work together? His phone buzzed again with the special tone, and this time it was the brigadier.</p><h2>The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer (1) (The Mara Dyer Trilogy)</h2><p>Mara Dyer doesn&#x2019;t know if she is crazy or haunted&#x2014;all she knows is that everyone around her is dying in this suspenseful and &#x201c;strong, inventive tale&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews)</i>.<br><br>Mara Dyer doesn&#x2019;t think life can get any stranger than waking up in a hospital with no memory of how she got there.<br> <i>It can.</i><br> She believes there must be more to the accident she can&#x2019;t remember that killed her friends and left her mysteriously unharmed.<br> <i>There is.</i><br> She doesn&#x2019;t believe that after everything she&#x2019;s been through, she can fall in love.<br> <i>She&#x2019;s wrong.</i><br> <br>After Mara survives the traumatizing accident at the old asylum, it makes sense that she has issues.

When Garrard was a nineteen-year-old college student, he was outed to his parents, and was forced to make a life-changing decision: either agree to attend a church-supported conversion therapy program that promised to "cure" him of homosexuality; or risk losing family, friends, and the God he had prayed to every day of his life. Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness. <br><br>By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, <i>Boy Erased </i>is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.</p><p>Garrard Conley is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling memoir&nbsp;<i>Boy Erased</i>, which has been translated in over a dozen languages and is now a major motion picture. <br><br>Conley is also a creator and producer of the podcast <i>UnErased</i>, which explores the history of conversion therapy in America through interviews, historical documents, and archival materials provided by the Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C. <br><br>His work can be found in&nbsp;<i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>, <i>TIME</i>,&nbsp;<i>VICE</i>,&nbsp;<i>CNN</i>,&nbsp;<i>BuzzFeed</i>,&nbsp;<i>Them</i>,&nbsp;<i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Huffington Post</i>, among other places.

Crumpton</i></p> <p><b>Why did you choose Africa as the place to begin your espionage work?</b></p> <p>Although having no experience or substantive knowledge of Africa, I had a brief training assignment in CIA headquarters Africa Division. I soon learned that Africa Division afforded rookie officers great opportunity to engage in a wide range of operations against many targets, including the Warsaw Bloc, Libyans, North Koreans, Chinese, and Iranians. In addition, the U.S. waged many of the hot, proxy battles of the Cold War in Africa and this offered unique espionage access, plus gave Africa Division officers a chance to advance policy makers&#x2019; understanding in this important arena. I was attracted to the independent, entrepreneurial, unconventional, iconoclastic, and bold CIA officers working in Africa. It was a &#x201c;fluid, unstructured, and churning environment&#x201d; where operational creativity was prized &#x2013; and had a huge influence on my leadership decisions years later in Afghanistan.</p> <p><b>You describe the important lessons you learned from African insurgent leaders. What were those lessons? What is and should be the CIA&#x2019;s role in so-called unconventional wars &#x2013; civil wars, guerilla wars, insurgencies?</b></p> <p>Insurgents in Africa taught me many lessons about war, from the tactical to the strategic, but most of all they impressed upon me that war is ultimately about people, fought by people among the people, all with their own values and aspirations. They taught me that understanding and charting the human terrain is an intelligence imperative, especially in unconventional war. I learned first hand the importance of pride, prestige, and honor in war. Why men fight will determine how they fight. The CIA will continue to play a leading role in intelligence and covert action where needed in irregular wars. Without understanding this human terrain, there is no victory for the U.S. or our local allies.</p> <p><b>After 9/11, why did the CIA have the lead role in Afghanistan? You had no military experience. Why were you selected to run this campaign? How did the U.S. overthrow the Taliban and cripple al Qaeda in just 90 days, with fewer than 500 Americans on the ground? </b></p> <p>The CIA&#x2019;s Counterterrorism Center (CTC) first established an office working exclusively against al Qaeda in 1996 and, after I joined CTC in 1999, we deployed CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with our Afghan allies against this terrorist target. The CIA knew far more about this enemy and Afghanistan than any U.S. government entity. During the summer of 2001, the CIA repeatedly warned the White House about an imminent al Qaeda attack against the U.S. In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attack, President Bush asked his national security team for a plan. CIA Director George Tenet and CTC Chief Cofer Black immediately responded with a clear and compelling argument for CIA leadership. The Department of Defense had no plan. President Bush, therefore, assigned unprecedented authorities to the CIA.</p> <p>Cofer Black selected me to lead the CIA campaign because for the previous two years, while serving as his Deputy in charge of all CIA global counterterrorist operations, I had advocated for a stronger role in Afghanistan. Moreover, I had run many high risk operations in many harsh environments, demonstrated strategic thought and planning capabilities, and exercised strong leadership skills.</p> <p>The quick defeat of the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan was a result of the CIA&#x2019;s robust intelligence networks and Afghan alliances built over the previous two years, reinforced by unique technical collection platforms such as the UAV Predator and superb precision bombing. This intelligence based strategy, executed by an extraordinary network of CIA team leaders on the ground, placed covert action and U.S. special operations in the forefront &#x2013; and ultimately rallied Afghan tribes to our side against the Taliban and their foreign interloper allies, al Qaeda.</p> <p><b>What are the key military lessons learned during and after the successful 2001-02 Afghanistan campaign? Why, more than 10 years later, are we still fighting in Afghanistan?</b></p> <p>The campaign underscored the value of intelligence, integration of multiple U.S. government entities, empathetic understanding and support to local partners, application of technology driven by specific needs (not vice-versa), a bias to the field, flat and networked organizations, speed and precision in force projection, and leadership.</p> <p>The United States, distracted with Iraq, and international community failed to secure the 01-02 Afghanistan victory with non-military power and did not address the growing enemy safe haven in Pakistan. Moreover, the U.S. struggles with accepting the changing nature of war, wherever it might be.</p> <p><b>You ran the CIA's clandestine operations inside the U.S. Why are CIA officers engaged in operations inside the U.S.? Does this pose a conflict with the FBI? What about the issues of civil liberties? What are the roles of U.S. citizens, universities, and companies in helping the CIA's Clandestine Service?</b></p> <p>The CIA&#x2019;s Clandestine Service relies on other government organizations and the U.S. private sector to achieve collection of foreign intelligence, both in the homeland and abroad. U.S. citizens may have direct access to this foreign intelligence or indirect through their foreign contacts. Sometimes there is a conflict with the FBI, although areas of cooperation are common and often deep. The CIA&#x2019;s relationship with the U.S. private sector is completely voluntary and confidential; U.S. citizens have the right and responsibility to cooperate with the CIA &#x2013; which is not a law enforcement organization. Concern about civil liberties rests more with expanded law enforcement authorities, with the overlapping powers of arrest and intelligence collection.</p> <p><b>The CIA has become more and more a paramilitary force, in some respects. Where is the line between intelligence and unconventional warfare?</b></p> <p>The line is increasingly blurred, which underscores the growing value of intelligence in not only war, but with all areas of statecraft. The CIA&#x2019;s Clandestine Service, first and foremost, should be about espionage, the clandestine collection of intelligence. This intelligence can determine and drive covert action, paramilitary or otherwise, but that should always be subordinated to and complementary of a robust foreign policy. Covert action should never be a substitute for foreign policy.</p> <p><b>You have criticized the post-9/11 bureaucracy that has put a supervising authority, a National Intelligence Director, above the CIA, is that working any better, or does it continue to make us less effective and thus less safe?</b></p> <p>The growing intelligence bureaucracy, including the DNI, is not effective. The entire effort is expensive, duplicative, Washington-centric, and burdened by an irrational Congressional oversight system. And, there are still major weaknesses in U.S. homeland intelligence collection and analysis. Paradoxically, the old pre-9/11 system outside the U.S. worked to a larger degree than policy makers?who failed to heed the CIA&#x2019;s warnings about al Qaeda?care to admit. The emphasis for intelligence improvement should be more about education, training, policies, and practices rather than more agencies in Washington DC.</p> <p>You lived and worked undercover in the foreign field for 14 years, mostly in Africa, accompanied by your wife and three young sons. What are the challenges on a CIA Clandestine Service officer with a family, especially when living abroad under cover? What is the spouse's role?</p> <p>The challenges are many, such as employing falsehoods for operational reasons and sometimes enduring prolonged absences from home, but for us the rewards far exceeded any burdens. We loved living overseas, and our children learned so much in these fascinating environments. We endeavored to create learning adventures for our boys, from exploring castles in Europe to backpacking in Africa. My spouse played an essential role in operations. Although unpaid and unrecognized for her brave duty, she participated in many of my operations, including the assessment/development of foreign agents, the smuggling of communications gear, and countersurveillance runs. She never waivered. She is my hero.</p> <p><b>What motivates a foreigner to spy for America, for the CIA?</b></p> <p>There are many motivations, including money, ideology, compromise, ego, revenge, and coercion. In most cases there is a blend of motivations. The best agents, in my experience, are those driven by a higher purpose. They are some of the bravest people imaginable. The prospective foreign agent, of course, must also have confidence and trust in the recruiting CIA operations officer who will be responsible for his security.</p> <p><b>Why did the CIA develop the UAV Predator program? Why not the Department of Defense?</b></p> <p>The CIA developed the UAV Predator program as a means to complement human intelligence reporting against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. U.S. policy makers lacked confidence in our human intelligence reporting as a basis for covert action. In response to this, the CIA&#x2019;s CTC built a network across the intelligence and defense community to imagine and construct a unique and highly effective surveillance system. Eventually, again in response to policymakers&#x2019; reluctance to take action against al Qaeda, this same CTC team figured out how to arm the UAV with Hellfire missiles. It was an extraordinary feat: the CIA cobbling together this intelligence/weapons system, by strapping an Army weapon on an Air Force vehicle, in only a few months. It would revolutionize warfare.</p> <p><b>There are several detailed accounts of you briefing and advising President George W. Bush and his leadership team at Camp David, the Situation Room, and the Oval Office during 2001-02. Usually accompanied by CIA Director George Tenet, you were sometimes in opposition to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and the Pentagon's view of the war. What were the differences? How was this managed?</b></p> <p>The differences centered on authorities and control. In retrospect, I believe that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld wanted complete control, at the expense of the CIA. The management of this was relatively straightforward, however, because we had great partnerships with Central Command and Special Ops Command, along with the US Army Special Forces and Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Moreover, it was a campaign driven by intelligence and relationships with our Afghan allies, built up over the years, and the CIA&#x2019;s CTC had the de facto lead, no matter what Secretary Rumsfeld wanted. In other words, to the extent possible, I ignored Rumsfeld and did my job.</p> <p><b>Why was your relationship with General Tommy Franks and the Special Operations leadership so important</b></p> <p>The key to success was integrating our intelligence and covert action into our military&#x2019;s superb capabilities, and forging networked, interdisciplinary teams suited for any mission. Thanks to General Franks and other military leaders, such as US Army Special Forces Colonel John Mulholland, we were able to do so. I also depended on key military advisors in my shop, such as US Army SF Colonel Ben Clark and JSOC operatives from Delta Force and the Navy SEALS.</p> <p><b>Was 9/11 an intelligence failure or more a policy failure? Why did the 9/11 Commission only address the intelligence aspects of this terrorist attack, not U.S. counter-terrorism policy?</b></p> <p>The 9/11 attack was primarily the result of prolonged U.S. policy failure during both the Clinton and the Bush Administrations. The 9/11 Commission, however, focused on the intelligence shortcomings, because the policy makers who established the Commission wanted to deflect any blame.</p><b>Henry A.

The only one to observe this phenomenon is a toddler in a fireman's hat who follows them and saves them from such disasters as bat caves, cliff-hanging, and hunger, along the way shouting very responsible warnings and imprecations to "behave." When he brings them safely home, he is, of course, a hero. In the penultimate spread, it transpires that the tale is the boy's fantasy story retold by his loving mother just before he falls asleep. The babies and their adventures are rendered in stunning, sharply detailed, Pienkowski-like silhouette against a subtly changing backdrop that reflects the time of day. The boy's fireman's hat makes him easy to follow on each spread and also conveys his gallant status. This book has levels of complexity. Adults may be put off by the seeming parental neglect, but children will doubtless latch on to and enjoy the fact that the hero is a child, that none of the escapees seems in any real jeopardy, that the softly glowing pastel backgrounds lend a mood of unruffled calm, and that the story is, after all, fanciful.

And you can read up on SQL syntax and keywords, and review sample code.</p><p>But...to really absorb and be able to apply your learning, <strong>you need to solve real-world problems</strong>.

Challenging problems with appropriate hints - use as needed. She should be writing other books.<br>- A. J.</p><p>I have numerous books on SQL, and have taken courses from people with lots of experience with data and SQL. Alas, knowing the material is not the same as being able to present it clearly and in digestible bites. Obviously, you have that knack. I have learned things from your book that nobody ever showed me before. I sincerely hope that you will write more books.<br> - H. V</p><p>I am starting from scratch, all self-taught so far in SQL, and was picking up the syntax and wording, but I could not find anything to give me real world application and scenarios. This book changed that! Great book, great problems, really makes you think, and still offers guidance!<br> - Molly G.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>I've been working with data for more than 20 years, as a database programmer/architect and data scientist, working at organizations like Expedia, Microsoft, T-Mobile, and the Gates Foundation. <br> <br>In 2015, I was teaching a SQL Server Certificate course at the University of Washington Continuing Education. It was a 10 week course, and my students paid more than $1000 for it. My students learned the basics of SQL, most of the keywords, and worked through practice problems every week of the course. <br> <br>But because of the emphasis on getting a broad overview of all features of SQL, we didn't spend nearly enough time on the type of SQL that's used 95% of the time--intermediate and advanced Select statements. After the course was over, many of my students emailed me to ask where they could get more real-world problems. That's when I was inspired to start work on SQL Practice Problems. <br> <br>Thank you so much to everyone who's contacted me with feedback. I've heard from so many people that working their way through SQL Practice Problems was what really made the difference in understanding SQL. Hearing from you is what keeps me motivated to continue updating and improving the content. </p>"Great book for any level!

But when a request for a "Great Wizzard" arrives in Ankh-Morpork via carrier albatross from the faraway Counterweight Continent, it's he who's sent as emissary. Chaos threatens to follow the impending demise of the Agatean Empire's current ruler. And, for some incomprehensible reason, someone believes Rincewind will have a mythic role in the war and wholesale bloodletting that will surely ensue. (Carnage is pretty much a given, since Cohen the Barbarian and his extremely elderly Silver Horde are busily formulating their own plan for looting, pillaging, and, er, looking wistfully at girls.) However, Rincewind firmly believes there are too many heroes already in the world, yet only one Rincewind.

They spoke hard words that often chafed and unsettled their listeners. Like the Old Testament prophets, and more recent prophetic voices like Frederick Douglass, Dr. Eric Mason calls the evangelical church to a much-needed reckoning. In a time when many feel confused, complacent, or even angry, he challenges the church to:</p><p>Be Aware &#x2013; to understand that the issue of justice is not a black issue, it&#x2019;s a kingdom issue.

She lives in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.PreSchool-Grade 2-- A city squirrel peeks out from his tree hole, inviting young listeners and beginning readers to a romp through a world of bold color, texture, and rhyme. This crafty creature digs in window pots overflowing with vivid blossoms and vegetables, does gymnastics to steal seeds from the birds, and begs for a treat at an apartment window. The rascal even sneaks inside for a look around and is quickly lured away by the narrator's offering of "nuts to you." Working with large stylized forms, Ehlert uses collage and watercolor staining techniques to define textures of earthy bark, brick, and fur. Contrasting bright hues of sky, vegetation, and birds add to the visual excitement. The simple, spirited plot, lively verse, and stunning double-page spreads will make Nuts to You! a story-time standard. And since the last four pages include information about a squirrel's body, home, and food, it can also be used in integrated language arts/science units.

A highly original inner path to self-knowledge, the Castle is also the road to spiritual knowledge of God and your own soul. In fact the soul is your spiritual castle and doing interior soul work helps you find your path in the world. <br> <br> Teresa of �vila's vision of the soul as a beautiful crystal castle with many mansions, and many rooms within those mansions, is the template for this modern spiritual journey on which you meet different aspects of your self and spirit and prepare for the ultimate encounter with God and your own divinity. Seven stages of intense practices and methods of spiritual inquiry develop your personal powers of prayer, contemplation, and intuition, which in turn reinforce your interior castle and build a soul of strength and stamina.With stories and inspiration from mystics of all traditions, Entering the Castle is a comprehensive guide for the journey of your life -- a journey into the center of your soul. There, peace, God, and a fearless joy wait for you to discover them...and claim them for your own.</p><p><b>Caroline Myss</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling books <i>Invisible Acts of Power, Sacred Contracts, Why People Don't Heal and How They Can,</i> and <i>Anatomy of the Spirit,</i> and is a pioneer and international lecturer in human consciousness.

What I would like to do, then, in just a few pages, is offer the reader some simple experiential reference points that might help to ground some of the central ideas of mystical or contemplative spirituality. I will first give seven of the most central ideas of mysticism and then attempt to give the reader a very quick, direct, experiential grounding in each of them.</p><p>The central ideas, if discussed merely theoretically, can sound rather dry and abstract. Here are the seven central ideas: (1) each of us has an outer self and an inner self; (2) the inner self lives in a timeless, eternal now; (3) the inner self is a great mystery, or pure emptiness and unknowingness; (4) the inner self is divine, or perfectly one with infinite spirit in a supreme identity; (5) hell is identification with the outer self; (6) heaven is the discovery and realization of the inner divine self, the supreme identity; (7) the divine self is one with the all, given in grace and sealed in glory.</p><p>Now, let's go in search of an experience of each of those items in just a few pages. Tall order? Not really, for you are already aware of, and fully experiencing, each of those items right now, according to the mystics. So let's see.</p><p></p><p><b></b></p><b>I</b><p>First, sit back and relax, take a few breaths, then let your awareness come easily to rest in this present moment and simply notice some of the things that you are aware of, right here and right now.</p><p>Notice, for example, some of the many things that you can see, things that are already arising effortlessly in your awareness. There are perhaps clouds floating by in the sky, leaves blowing in the wind, raindrops on the roof, the city skyline all brightly lighted against the evening's darkness, or the sun shining brightly on the horizon as it is about to begin its journey across the sky. These things take no effort to be aware of; they are simply arising in your awareness, spontaneously and effortlessly, right now.</p><p>Just as there are clouds floating by in the sky, there are thoughts floating by in the space of your mind. Notice that these thoughts arise, stay a bit, and pass. You don't choose most of them; thoughts simply emerge out of what seems to be nothingness or emptiness, parade across the screen of your awareness, and fade back into nothingness. The same with feelings in your body. There might be a sensation of discomfort in my feet; a feeling of warmth in my tummy; a tingling in my fingertips; an intense burst of excitement around my heart; a warm pleasure washing over my body. All these feelings simply arise of their own, stay a bit, and pass.</p><p>As I look inward, noticing thoughts and feelings arising in the inner spaces of my own awareness, I can also notice this thing called me or my self. There are many things I might know about myself -- some of which I might be pleased with, some of which I might be annoyed with, and some of which I might find positively horrifying or alarming. But whatever I might think about this thing called my self, it certainly seems that there are numerous things I can know about it.</p><p>There even seem to be several of these selves, a fact announced by a plethora of pop psychology books. There is my wounded child; my harsh superego; my cynical and even bitter skeptic; my ever-present controller, seeking to control both me and everybody else; my wise old man and wise old woman; my spiritual seeker; my fearful persona, which lets fear make too many of my life's choices for me; the joyous persona, finding a constant current of joy and happiness in this and every moment; to name a prominent few....</p><p>But notice something fascinating about all these selves: They are all something that I can see, that I can be aware of, that I can feel and know and describe, in many ways. They can all be seen -- but who or what is the seer? All those selves, which I just looked within, saw, and felt, and then described -- are objects that can be seen: But what is the subject, the actual self, the actual seer of those seen things, the true knower of those known things?</p><p>Get a good sense of yourself right now -- just try to be aware of what you call "yourself" right now. Try to see or feel yourself as clearly as you can. Notice that, once you get a sense of seeing or feeling or being aware of yourself right now, what you are seeing is an object, not a true subject. That is, the self that you are seeing -- the self that you call yourself and that you take to be a real self -- is actually an object. It's not even a real self or real subject, but simply an object or something that can be seen. Everything that you know about yourself, everything that you are used to calling yourself, is not actually a self or a real subject but just a bunch of objects, a bunch of things that can be seen. But who or what is the seer, the real subject or real self?</p><p>To begin with, don't try to see your true self, because anything that you can see is just another object, just another thing that can be seen, and not the seer itself. As the mystics are fond of saying, the true self is not this, not that. Rather, as you attempt to get in touch with this real self or subject, just begin by letting go of all the objects that you have previously identified with. Anything that you can see or know about yourself is not your true self anyway, but just another object, so let it go, just let it go, and begin instead to disidentify with whatever you thought was yourself. Try this exercise, saying to yourself:</p><p>"I have thoughts, but I am not my thoughts. I have feelings, but I am not my feelings. I have desires, but I am not desires. I have wishes, but I am not those wishes. I have intense pleasure and excruciating pain, but I am neither of those. I have a body, but I am not my body. I have a mind, but I am not my mind. All those can be seen, but I am the seer; all those can be known, but I am the knower; all those are merely objects, but I am a real subject or true self, not any passing parts and pieces and objects and things. I am not thoughts, not feelings, not desires, not body, not mind, not this, not that.</p><p>So who or what am I?</p><p>Before proceeding, let's say that, according to the evidence of our experience right now, we have at least two selves, or two sorts of selves -- there is the self that can be seen and known, and the self that cannot be seen or known. There is the unknown seer, and there are all the little selves seen. Philosophers have some fancy words for this: the transcendental self (or pure I AMness, which can never be an object, seen or known) and the empirical self (or the empirical ego, which can be seen, known, experienced, and objectified).</p><p>Even though the transcendental seer cannot itself be seen -- that would be just another object -- it nevertheless sees the entire majesty in front of its eyes: Unseen, it sees all; unknown, it knows all; unfelt, it feels all.</p><p>For this reason, the true self is often called the witness: It witnesses all that is occurring but cannot itself be turned into an object -- as a true subject, it cannot be objectified. It is also called the mirror mind -- it effortlessly and spontaneously reflects everything that arises, but does not grasp or keep. The true self is, in some sense, a deep mystery, something that can never be seen, and yet it sees the entire universe in front of it. It is a vast emptiness, and yet out of it the entire world seems to spring.</p><p>For the moment, please keep asking yourself, "What is this self of mine?" Keep trying to feel into that question, keep trying to think the thinker, feel the feeler, and see the seer. As you proceed in that fashion, asking yourself, "Who am I?" and gently letting go of all the objects that you thought you were, and as you keep trying to see the seer, you actually won't see anything specific -- you won't see any particular things or processes or events or objects (or, if you do, they're just more objects -- exactly what you are not trying to find). Rather, as you keep relaxing into the seer, all you will find is a sense of release from objects, release from the small and narrow identities with objects that you used to call you. All you will find, in other words, is not another object but an atmosphere of freedom, liberation, and release -- release from the pain and torment of identifying with a bunch of little objects that come, stay a bit, and pass, lacerating you in the process. According to the mystics, the closer you get to your true self, the greater the sense of infinite freedom.</p><p>As I rest in the unknown knower, in this pure self or witness, I might notice something else about this self: It doesn't move -- it isn't touched by time or motion, date or duration. This transparent witness is aware of time, hence itself is timeless, or existing in the timeless now. The witness is aware of past thoughts, but past thoughts occur now; and the witness is aware of future thoughts, but future thoughts occur now -- and when the real past occurred, it was a now moment, and when the real future occurs, it will be a now moment. The only thing the witness is aware of, the only thing that is real, is an endless present, a single now moment through which time passes, but it is not itself touched by time at all, yet rather lives in eternity. And eternity does not mean everlasting time but a moment without time. Wittgenstein saw it c...</p></p>
